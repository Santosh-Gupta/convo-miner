       "      <td>In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennet's visit, and sat about ten       minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being       admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard       much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,       for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he       wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</td>\n",

       "      <td>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had       Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her       housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</td>\n",

They attacked him in       various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and       distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at       last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,       Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been       delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly       with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful!

       "148  In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennet's visit, and sat about ten       minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being       admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard       much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,       for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he       wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "149  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had       Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her       housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.   \n",
       "150  Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
