The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent       against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was       sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Mr Bingley had not been of age two       years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at       Netherfield House.

       "99  [Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of       great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

It was       generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to       her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference       which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way       to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not       likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with       great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform       cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend MissLucas.\",\n",

There was no help for       it, however. Mr Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a       little longer, and Mr Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as       she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea       it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that she       was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of       Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings,       in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to       conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and       heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and       though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her       charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the       probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her.       Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that       a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr Collins might       never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about       him.\",\n",

The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were       dances of mortification.

She saw her in idea settled in that very       house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could       bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumsances, of endeavouring       even to like Bingley's two sisters.

It was, moreover, such a promising       thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw       them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her       time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of       their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than       she liked.

Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said, \\'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On       that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are       married.\"',\n",

You will not, I       hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,       by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without       having paid yourself and Mr Bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be       objectionable in having accepted my dismisson from your daughter\\'s lips       instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly       meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an       amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of       all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I       here beg leave to apologise.\"',\n",

Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more       interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer       Mr Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided       opinion, that whenever Mr Collins should be in possession of the       Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife       should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,       were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of       coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have       done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's       dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had       gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in       general satisfactory. Mr Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor       agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be       imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly       either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was       the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and       however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest       preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the       age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the       good luck of it. The least agreeable circumsance in the business was the       surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued       beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably       would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her       feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her       the information herself, and therefore charged Mr Collins, when he       returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before       any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully       given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity       excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on       his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same       time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his       prosperous love.\",\n",

He had entertained hopes of being       admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard       much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,       for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he       wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</td>\n",

Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.</td>\n",

His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</td>\n",

Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent       against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was       sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.</td>\n",

They attacked him in       various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and       distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at       last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,       Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been       delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly       with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful!

       "86  In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennet's visit, and sat about ten       minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being       admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard       much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,       for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he       wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "87  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had       Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her       housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.   \n",
       "88  Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "89  Mr Bingley had soon made himslf acquainted with all the principal people       in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry       that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himslf at       Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent       against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was       sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "90  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit       down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr Darcy had been       standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr       Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to       join it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
