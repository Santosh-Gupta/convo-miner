But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody       can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down       the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her       for the two next.

Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said, \\'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.

       " ('\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for       every clergyman in easy circumsances (like myself) to set the example of       matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add       very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to       have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and       recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling       patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said, \\'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On       that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are       married.\"',\n",

Resignation to       inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man       who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust       I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive       happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied       begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I       hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,       by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without       having paid yourself and Mr Bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be       objectionable in having accepted my dismisson from your daughter\\'s lips       instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly       meant well through the whole affair.

But, my dear sister,       though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I       still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was       as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for       wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumsances were to       happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not       return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive       in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,       said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so       altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to       continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming       her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say       that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure       that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself       farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet       if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so       deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on       his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her       having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we       must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from       something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of       talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to       MissDarcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging       harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong       appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every       painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your       affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me       hear from you very soon. MissBingley said something of his never       returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any       certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have       such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them,       with Sir William and Maria.

We dressed up Chamberlayne in       woman\\'s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a       soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs Forster, and Kitty and me, except my       aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot       imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or       three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord!       how I laughed! and so did Mrs Forster.

       "  '\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I       wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my       head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest       Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and       it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr Wickham and       our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken       place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day       before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\\'s short letter to       Mrs F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green,       something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never       intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to       Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to       trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;       for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and       dismissd the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after       this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what       to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel       F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the       turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no       such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he       came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most       creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs F., but       no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very       great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill       of him. Many circumsances might make it more eligible for them to be       married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he       could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia\\'s connections,       which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible!       I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon       their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he       feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and       keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is       not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so       affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but       as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad,       dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing       scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for       your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if       inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told       you I would not; but circumsances are such that I cannot help earnestly       begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and       aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still       something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with       Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I       am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to       pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is       obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my       uncle\\'s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will       immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"',\n",
