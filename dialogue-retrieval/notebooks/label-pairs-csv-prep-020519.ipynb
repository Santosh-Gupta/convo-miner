Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.]  \n",
       "69  [Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again.

Mr Bingley had not been of age two       years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at       Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was       pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what       the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "

Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.]   \n",
       "69  [Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again.

Mr Bingley had not been of age two       years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at       Netherfield House.

       "99  [Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of       great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

They attacked him in       various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and       distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at       last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,       Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been       delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly       with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful!

She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.   \n",
       "69  Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "70  Mr Bingley had soon made himslf acquainted with all the principal people       in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry       that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himslf at       Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent       against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was       sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "71  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit       down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr Darcy had been       standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr       Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to       join it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "79  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs       Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.       Mr Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by       his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,       though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard       herself mentioned to MissBingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to       be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at       a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the       village where they lived, and of which they were the principal       inhabitants. They found Mr Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless       of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to       the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He       had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

They attacked him in       various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and       distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at       last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,       Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been       delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly       with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful!

She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.   \n",
       "68  Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "69  Mr Bingley had soon made himslf acquainted with all the principal people       in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry       that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himslf at       Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent       against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was       sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "70  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit       down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr Darcy had been       standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr       Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to       join it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "78  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs       Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.       Mr Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by       his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,       though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard       herself mentioned to MissBingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to       be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at       a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the       village where they lived, and of which they were the principal       inhabitants. They found Mr Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless       of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to       the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He       had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "99  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently       characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or       prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to       him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt       acquainted with all the room; and, as to MissBennet, he could not       conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a       collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for       none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received       either attention or pleasure. MissBennet he acknowledged to be pretty,       but she smiled too much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
