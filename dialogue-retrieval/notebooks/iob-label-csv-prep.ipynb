Vanity and pride are different things, though       the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being       vain.

Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin.

His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again.

Mr Bingley had not been of age two       years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at       Netherfield House.

       "99  (99, n, , narrative, Chapter 4, Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of       great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been       delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly       with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful!

       "67  In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennet's visit, and sat about ten       minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being       admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard       much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,       for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he       wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "68  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had       Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her       housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.   \n",
       "69  Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "70  Mr Bingley had soon made himslf acquainted with all the principal people       in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry       that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himslf at       Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent       against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was       sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "71  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit       down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr Darcy had been       standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr       Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to       join it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "79  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs       Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.       Mr Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by       his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,       though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard       herself mentioned to MissBingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to       be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at       a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the       village where they lived, and of which they were the principal       inhabitants. They found Mr Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless       of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to       the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He       had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Jane       was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she       looked; and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her       twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her       twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second       time. First of all, he asked MissLucas. I was so vexed to see him stand       up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody       can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down       the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her       for the two next.

       "98  His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though       he was now only established as a tenant, MissBingley was by no means       unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs Hurst, who had       married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his       house as her home when it suited her. Mr Bingley had not been of age two       years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at       Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was       pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what       the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "99  Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of       great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Everybody said how well she       looked; and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her       twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her       twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second       time. First of all, he asked MissLucas. I was so vexed to see him stand       up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody       can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down       the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her       for the two next. Then the two third he danced with MissKing, and the two       fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two       sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger—\"   \n",

       "      <td>Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</td>\n",

Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin.

His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again.

Mr Bingley had not been of age two       years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at       Netherfield House.

       "99  (99, n, , narrative, Chapter 4, Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of       great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been       delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly       with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful!

       "67  In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennet's visit, and sat about ten       minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being       admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard       much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,       for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he       wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "68  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had       Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her       housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr Bingley       was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to       accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs Bennet was quite       disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party       entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young       man.   \n",
       "69  Mr Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,       with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely       looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of       the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the       report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his       entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "70  Mr Bingley had soon made himslf acquainted with all the principal people       in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry       that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himslf at       Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themslves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs       Hurst and once with MissBingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent       against him was Mrs Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was       sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "71  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit       down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr Darcy had been       standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr       Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to       join it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "79  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs       Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.       Mr Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by       his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,       though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard       herself mentioned to MissBingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to       be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at       a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the       village where they lived, and of which they were the principal       inhabitants. They found Mr Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless       of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to       the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He       had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Jane       was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she       looked; and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her       twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her       twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second       time. First of all, he asked MissLucas. I was so vexed to see him stand       up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody       can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down       the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her       for the two next.

       "98  His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though       he was now only established as a tenant, MissBingley was by no means       unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs Hurst, who had       married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his       house as her home when it suited her. Mr Bingley had not been of age two       years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at       Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was       pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what       the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "99  Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of       great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the       easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition       could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he       never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that       respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being       liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Everybody said how well she       looked; and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her       twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her       twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second       time. First of all, he asked MissLucas. I was so vexed to see him stand       up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody       can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down       the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her       for the two next. Then the two third he danced with MissKing, and the two       fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two       sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger—\"   \n",
