It had given him a disgust to his       business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting       them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from       Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think       with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy       himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his       rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all       attention to everybody.

Though he had       detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in       her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and       pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of       the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this       she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself       agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with.</td>\n",

       "100  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently       characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or       prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to       him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt       acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not       conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a       collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for       none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received       either attention or pleasure.

       "103  Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were       particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in       Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of       knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction       had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his       business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting       them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from       Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think       with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy       himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his       rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all       attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his       presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "122  \"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her       reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe.

Vanity and pride are different things, though       the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being       vain.

Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the       goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found       to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish       of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two       eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure,       but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,       hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their       kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all       probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was       generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to       her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference       which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way       to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not       likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with       great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform       cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.   \n",

There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that       it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a       slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have       heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out       of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels.

       "138  Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth       was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some       interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely       allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the       ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no       sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had       a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To       this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had       detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in       her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and       pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of       the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this       she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself       agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with.                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "184  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient       distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or       four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's       shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and       Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were       more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk       to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in       general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At       present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by       the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to       remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
