It had given him a disgust to his       business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting       them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from       Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think       with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy       himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his       rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all       attention to everybody.

Of this       she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself       agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with.</td>\n",

       "100  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently       characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or       prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to       him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt       acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not       conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a       collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for       none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received       either attention or pleasure.

       "103  Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were       particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in       Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of       knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction       had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his       business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting       them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from       Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think       with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy       himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his       rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all       attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his       presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "122  \"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her       reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe.

Vanity and pride are different things, though       the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being       vain.

Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the       goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found       to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish       of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two       eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure,       but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,       hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their       kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all       probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was       generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to       her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference       which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way       to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not       likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with       great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform       cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.   \n",

There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that       it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a       slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have       heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out       of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels.

       "138  Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth       was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some       interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely       allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the       ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no       sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had       a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To       this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had       detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in       her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and       pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of       the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this       she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself       agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with.                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "184  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient       distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or       four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's       shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and       Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were       more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk       to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in       general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At       present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by       the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to       remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said, \\'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.

But, my dear sister,       though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I       still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was       as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for       wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumsances were to       happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not       return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive       in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,       said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so       altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to       continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming       her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say       that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure       that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself       farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet       if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so       deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on       his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her       having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we       must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from       something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of       talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to       MissDarcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging       harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong       appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every       painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your       affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me       hear from you very soon. MissBingley said something of his never       returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any       certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have       such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them,       with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours,       etc.\"',\n",
