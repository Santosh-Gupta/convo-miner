      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\r\n",

      "told me all about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bennet made no answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\r\n",
      "by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\r\n",
      "down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\r\n",
      "delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he\r\n",

      "“How so? How can it affect them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Is that his design in settling here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\r\n",

      "soon as he comes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\r\n",
      "them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\r\n",
      "as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\r\n",

      "grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\r\n",
      "be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\r\n",
      "go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\r\n",
      "newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\r\n",
      "visit him if you do not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\r\n",
      "I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\r\n",
      "others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\r\n",
      "good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are\r\n",
      "all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\r\n",
      "quickness than her sisters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\r\n",
      "take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\r\n",
      "are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\r\n",
      "these last twenty years at least.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\r\n",

      "all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\r\n",
      "reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\r\n",
      "been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\r\n",
      "was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,\r\n",
      "little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,\r\n",
      "she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\r\n",

      "his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\r\n",
      "paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\r\n",
      "manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\r\n",

      "he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\r\n",

      "was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\r\n",
      "one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\r\n",
      "themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\r\n",
      "only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\r\n",
      "introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\r\n",
      "walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\r\n",
      "His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\r\n",
      "in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\r\n",
      "Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\r\n",
      "down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\r\n",
      "particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\r\n",
      "it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\r\n",

      "stand up with.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\r\n",
      "uncommonly pretty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\r\n",

      "humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\r\n",
      "by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\r\n",
      "smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\r\n",
      "remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\r\n",

      "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\r\n",

      "party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\r\n",
      "distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as\r\n",
      "her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's\r\n",
      "pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\r\n",
      "accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\r\n",
      "fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\r\n",
      "had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\r\n",
      "spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\r\n",
      "were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With\r\n",
      "a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\r\n",
      "good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\r\n",
      "such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on\r\n",
      "the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\r\n",
      "different story to hear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\r\n",
      "delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\r\n",
      "Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\r\n",
      "she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\r\n",
      "her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her\r\n",
      "twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\r\n",
      "time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\r\n",
      "up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\r\n",
      "can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\r\n",
      "down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\r\n",
      "asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,\r\n",
      "and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,\r\n",
      "and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\r\n",
      "“he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of\r\n",
      "his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\r\n",
      "handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw\r\n",
      "anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\r\n",
      "Hurst's gown--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\r\n",
      "description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\r\n",
      "of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\r\n",
      "exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\r\n",
      "suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\r\n",
      "all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\r\n",
      "him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\r\n",
      "great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\r\n",

      "in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\r\n",

      "none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\r\n",

      "Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\r\n",
      "were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\r\n",
      "in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\r\n",
      "honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\r\n",
      "The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\r\n",
      "disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\r\n",
      "and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house\r\n",
      "about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,\r\n",
      "where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\r\n",
      "unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all\r\n",
      "the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\r\n",
      "supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By\r\n",
      "nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\r\n",
      "James's had made him courteous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\r\n",
      "valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\r\n",
      "of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\r\n",

      "“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as\r\n",
      "if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\r\n",

      "“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\r\n",

      "ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite\r\n",
      "a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\r\n",
      "sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\r\n",
      "could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at\r\n",
      "being spoke to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,\r\n",
      "unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably\r\n",
      "agreeable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\r\n",
      "agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\r\n",
      "was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\r\n",
      "heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\r\n",
      "the ball in a hack chaise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\r\n",
      "very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\r\n",
      "should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\r\n",
      "reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\r\n",
      "ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\r\n",
      "nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\r\n",
      "who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\r\n",
      "quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\r\n",
      "things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may\r\n",
      "be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\r\n",
      "ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with\r\n",
      "his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\r\n",
      "foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\r\n",

      "directly.”\r\n",

      "The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\r\n",
      "was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on\r\n",
      "the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\r\n",
      "found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\r\n",
      "a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\r\n",
      "the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\r\n",
      "pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\r\n",
      "of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\r\n",
      "though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\r\n",
      "all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It\r\n",
      "was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\r\n",
      "to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\r\n",
      "which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\r\n",
      "way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\r\n",
      "was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\r\n",
      "united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\r\n",
      "uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions\r\n",
      "of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\r\n",
      "on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\r\n",
      "so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\r\n",
      "from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\r\n",
      "it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in\r\n",
      "the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\r\n",
      "attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\r\n",
      "_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\r\n",
      "very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\r\n",
      "encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_\r\n",
      "affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\r\n",
      "may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\r\n",
      "perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\r\n",
      "discover it too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\r\n",
      "it, he must find it out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\r\n",
      "meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\r\n",
      "always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\r\n",
      "every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\r\n",
      "therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\r\n",
      "attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\r\n",
      "falling in love as much as she chooses.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\r\n",
      "question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined\r\n",
      "to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\r\n",
      "these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,\r\n",
      "she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its\r\n",
      "reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\r\n",
      "dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\r\n",
      "and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite\r\n",
      "enough to make her understand his character.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\r\n",
      "only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\r\n",
      "remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four\r\n",
      "evenings may do a great deal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\r\n",
      "both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\r\n",
      "leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and\r\n",
      "if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\r\n",
      "chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\r\n",
      "twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\r\n",
      "the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or\r\n",
      "ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\r\n",
      "least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\r\n",
      "have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\r\n",
      "possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\r\n",
      "life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\r\n",
      "sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\r\n",
      "was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\r\n",
      "interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\r\n",
      "allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\r\n",
      "ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\r\n",
      "sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\r\n",
      "had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\r\n",
      "uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\r\n",
      "this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\r\n",
      "detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\r\n",
      "in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\r\n",
      "pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\r\n",
      "of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\r\n",
      "this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\r\n",
      "himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\r\n",
      "to dance with.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\r\n",
      "with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\r\n",
      "drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were\r\n",
      "assembled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\r\n",
      "conversation with Colonel Forster?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\r\n",
      "what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\r\n",
      "being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\r\n",
      "any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\r\n",
      "a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\r\n",
      "turned to him and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\r\n",
      "well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\r\n",
      "Meryton?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“You are severe on us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\r\n",
      "to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\r\n",
      "to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken\r\n",
      "a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\r\n",
      "really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\r\n",
      "hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,\r\n",
      "she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\r\n",
      "at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\r\n",

      "shall keep mine to swell my song.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that\r\n",
      "she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\r\n",
      "sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\r\n",
      "the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\r\n",
      "impatient for display.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\r\n",
      "application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\r\n",
      "manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\r\n",
      "had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\r\n",
      "much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\r\n",
      "end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\r\n",
      "Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\r\n",
      "with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\r\n",
      "dancing at one end of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\r\n",
      "passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\r\n",
      "much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\r\n",
      "his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\r\n",

      "“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\r\n",
      "you often dance at St. James's?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\r\n",

      "in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's\r\n",
      "fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\r\n",

      "to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\r\n",
      "Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\r\n",
      "their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing\r\n",

      "the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\r\n",
      "from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\r\n",

      "hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.\r\n",
      "Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been\r\n",
      "to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\r\n",
      "matter with me.--Yours, etc.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\r\n",
      "aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\r\n",
      "should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\r\n",

      "all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\r\n",

      "field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\r\n",
      "over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\r\n",
      "within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face\r\n",
      "glowing with the warmth of exercise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\r\n",

      "That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such\r\n",
      "dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\r\n",
      "for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\r\n",
      "brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there\r\n",
      "was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\r\n",
      "Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\r\n",
      "brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as\r\n",
      "to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\r\n",
      "thinking only of his breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not\r\n",
      "well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\r\n",

      "alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed\r\n",
      "for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\r\n",
      "however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them\r\n",
      "together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\r\n",
      "extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\r\n",
      "began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\r\n",
      "solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having\r\n",
      "examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\r\n",
      "a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\r\n",
      "advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\r\n",
      "was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\r\n",
      "ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\r\n",
      "the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in\r\n",
      "fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\r\n",
      "unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\r\n",
      "wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\r\n",
      "in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\r\n",
      "of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\r\n",

      "poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\r\n",
      "much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very\r\n",
      "favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\r\n",
      "this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\r\n",
      "shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\r\n",

      "attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\r\n",
      "herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\r\n",
      "others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\r\n",
      "engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\r\n",
      "Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\r\n",
      "eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain\r\n",
      "dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\r\n",
      "began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\r\n",
      "pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\r\n",
      "she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\r\n",
      "walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\r\n",
      "looked almost wild.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\r\n",
      "nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\r\n",
      "country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\r\n",
      "in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\r\n",
      "hide it not doing its office.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\r\n",
      "all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\r\n",
      "well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\r\n",
      "escaped my notice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\r\n",

      "an exhibition.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\r\n",
      "above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\r\n",
      "it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\r\n",
      "a most country-town indifference to decorum.”\r\n",

      "“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\r\n",
      "short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\r\n",
      "sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\r\n",

      "“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\r\n",
      "consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\r\n",
      "hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\r\n",
      "their dear friend's vulgar relations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\r\n",
      "leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\r\n",
      "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\r\n",
      "late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and\r\n",
      "when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\r\n",
      "downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\r\n",
      "party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\r\n",
      "them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\r\n",
      "excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\r\n",
      "below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\r\n",
      "reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am\r\n",
      "_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\r\n",
      "I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\r\n",
      "table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\r\n",
      "others--all that his library afforded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\r\n",
      "credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\r\n",
      "than I ever looked into.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\r\n",
      "in the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\r\n",
      "so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\r\n",
      "Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many\r\n",
      "generations.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\r\n",
      "books.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\r\n",
      "these.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\r\n",
      "that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\r\n",
      "half as delightful as Pemberley.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish it may.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\r\n",
      "neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\r\n",
      "finer county in England than Derbyshire.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\r\n",
      "Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very\r\n",
      "little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew\r\n",
      "near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his\r\n",
      "eldest sister, to observe the game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will\r\n",
      "she be as tall as I am?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\r\n",
      "rather taller.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\r\n",
      "so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\r\n",
      "for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\r\n",
      "to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\r\n",
      "net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\r\n",
      "I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\r\n",
      "informed that she was very accomplished.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\r\n",
      "too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\r\n",
      "otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very\r\n",
      "far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\r\n",
      "cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\r\n",
      "acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\r\n",
      "idea of an accomplished woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\r\n",
      "esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\r\n",
      "with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\r\n",
      "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides\r\n",
      "all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\r\n",
      "walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\r\n",
      "will be but half-deserved.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must\r\n",
      "yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\r\n",
      "extensive reading.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\r\n",
      "I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\r\n",
      "this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and\r\n",
      "application, and elegance, as you describe united.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\r\n",
      "implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\r\n",
      "answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\r\n",
      "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\r\n",
      "conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\r\n",
      "“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\r\n",
      "other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\r\n",
      "succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\r\n",
      "“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\r\n",
      "to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\r\n",
      "despicable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\r\n",
      "continue the subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\r\n",
      "that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\r\n",
      "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\r\n",
      "be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\r\n",
      "eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\r\n",
      "unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\r\n",
      "that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\r\n",
      "were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\r\n",
      "declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\r\n",
      "however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief\r\n",
      "to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\r\n",
      "attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chapter 9\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the\r\n",
      "morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\r\n",
      "inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\r\n",
      "and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\r\n",
      "sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\r\n",
      "note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\r\n",
      "own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\r\n",
      "its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\r\n",
      "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\r\n",
      "very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\r\n",
      "not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\r\n",
      "restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\r\n",
      "would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried\r\n",
      "home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\r\n",
      "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\r\n",
      "attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\r\n",
      "that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\r\n",
      "moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\r\n",
      "a little longer on your kindness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\r\n",
      "sure, will not hear of her removal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\r\n",
      "“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she\r\n",
      "remains with us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not\r\n",
      "know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\r\n",
      "a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\r\n",
      "always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\r\n",
      "temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are\r\n",
      "nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a\r\n",
      "charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the\r\n",
      "country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it\r\n",
      "in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\r\n",
      "should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\r\n",
      "minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\r\n",
      "through I am afraid is pitiful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\r\n",
      "character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\r\n",
      "the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a\r\n",
      "studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\r\n",
      "least that advantage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for\r\n",
      "such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\r\n",
      "unvarying society.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\r\n",
      "observed in them for ever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning\r\n",
      "a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\r\n",
      "going on in the country as in town.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\r\n",
      "turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\r\n",
      "victory over him, continued her triumph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\r\n",
      "my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\r\n",
      "pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;\r\n",
      "and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\r\n",
      "advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\r\n",
      "gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\r\n",
      "at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\r\n",
      "mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\r\n",
      "such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\r\n",
      "which you must acknowledge to be true.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\r\n",
      "with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\r\n",
      "neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\r\n",
      "countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\r\n",
      "saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\r\n",
      "Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\r\n",
      "William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\r\n",
      "genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\r\n",
      "is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\r\n",
      "important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\r\n",
      "my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\r\n",
      "_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\r\n",
      "judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\r\n",
      "I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\r\n",
      "Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\r\n",
      "has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast\r\n",
      "of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\r\n",
      "better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\r\n",
      "partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\r\n",
      "Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\r\n",
      "sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\r\n",
      "did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\r\n",
      "on her, and very pretty they were.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has\r\n",
      "been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\r\n",
      "discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\r\n",
      "strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\r\n",
      "am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\r\n",
      "tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\r\n",
      "speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\r\n",
      "Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\r\n",
      "unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\r\n",
      "civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\r\n",
      "indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\r\n",
      "soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\r\n",
      "her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\r\n",
      "each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\r\n",
      "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\r\n",
      "into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\r\n",
      "and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\r\n",
      "affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\r\n",
      "animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\r\n",
      "attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own\r\n",
      "easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\r\n",
      "equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\r\n",
      "abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\r\n",
      "shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\r\n",
      "sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\r\n",
      "your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\r\n",
      "the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better to\r\n",
      "wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\r\n",
      "would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\r\n",
      "added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\r\n",

      "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\r\n",
      "you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\r\n",

      "brother for talking such nonsense.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,\r\n",

      "that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed\r\n",
      "on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\r\n",
      "admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her\r\n",
      "because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,\r\n",
      "however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something\r\n",
      "more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\r\n",
      "any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\r\n",

      "surprise at her silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately\r\n",
      "determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'\r\n",
      "that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\r\n",
      "delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\r\n",
      "their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\r\n",
      "you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\r\n",
      "gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\r\n",
      "manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy\r\n",
      "had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\r\n",
      "believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\r\n",
      "should be in some danger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\r\n",

      "assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery\r\n",

      "desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\r\n",

      "in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\r\n",
      "judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\r\n",

      "sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\r\n",
      "drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\r\n",
      "professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\r\n",
      "as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\r\n",
      "Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\r\n",
      "entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh\r\n",
      "at their acquaintance with spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had\r\n",
      "something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\r\n",
      "himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also\r\n",
      "made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\r\n",
      "and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and\r\n",
      "attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\r\n",
      "should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire\r\n",
      "to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from\r\n",
      "the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\r\n",
      "else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\r\n",
      "delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\r\n",
      "card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\r\n",
      "petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and\r\n",
      "the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\r\n",
      "Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\r\n",
      "sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets\r\n",
      "and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\r\n",

      "was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\r\n",
      "could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\r\n",
      "question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\r\n",
      "amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\r\n",
      "second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant\r\n",
      "it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\r\n",
      "enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\r\n",
      "book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\r\n",
      "an excellent library.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\r\n",
      "cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing\r\n",
      "her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\r\n",
      "towards him and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\r\n",
      "Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\r\n",
      "the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are\r\n",
      "not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\r\n",
      "pleasure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\r\n",
      "chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\r\n",
      "thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send\r\n",
      "round my cards.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\r\n",
      "carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\r\n",
      "tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\r\n",
      "more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of\r\n",

      "him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\r\n",
      "commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\r\n",
      "young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\r\n",
      "His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\r\n",
      "beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\r\n",
      "The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\r\n",
      "of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\r\n",
      "unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\r\n",
      "very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\r\n",
      "and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\r\n",
      "ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\r\n",
      "began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\r\n",
      "Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\r\n",
      "Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\r\n",
      "it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\r\n",
      "on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\r\n",
      "stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\r\n",
      "looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\r\n",
      "with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and\r\n",
      "the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\r\n",
      "gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive\r\n",
      "listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\r\n",
      "heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\r\n",
      "soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\r\n",
      "and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\r\n",
      "their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\r\n",
      "interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\r\n",
      "The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\r\n",
      "of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.\r\n",
      "The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\r\n",
      "gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\r\n",
      "walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,\r\n",
      "breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\r\n",
      "turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\r\n",
      "himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\r\n",
      "conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel\r\n",
      "that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered\r\n",
      "interesting by the skill of the speaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\r\n",
      "officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\r\n",
      "ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\r\n",
      "listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\r\n",
      "supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he\r\n",
      "had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad\r\n",
      "to improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very\r\n",
      "glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\r\n",
      "received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\r\n",
      "seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\r\n",
      "determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\r\n",
      "she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\r\n",
      "and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\r\n",
      "Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\r\n",
      "at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear\r\n",
      "him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\r\n",
      "told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\r\n",
      "even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\r\n",
      "relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\r\n",
      "Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\r\n",
      "a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\r\n",
      "drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\r\n",
      "understand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear\r\n",
      "ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more\r\n",
      "capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\r\n",
      "I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my\r\n",
      "infancy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\r\n",
      "seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\r\n",
      "yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have\r\n",
      "spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\r\n",
      "disagreeable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\r\n",
      "agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\r\n",
      "too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_\r\n",
      "to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\r\n",
      "astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\r\n",
      "anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\r\n",
      "the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\r\n",
      "Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\r\n",
      "him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\r\n",
      "interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\r\n",
      "their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\r\n",
      "world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\r\n",
      "high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\r\n",
      "ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\r\n",
      "likely to be in this country much longer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\r\n",
      "was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\r\n",
      "not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\r\n",
      "wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\r\n",
      "and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\r\n",
      "avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\r\n",
      "of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\r\n",
      "is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\r\n",
      "that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\r\n",
      "be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\r\n",
      "a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\r\n",
      "scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\r\n",
      "everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\r\n",
      "memory of his father.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\r\n",
      "all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\r\n",
      "neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\r\n",
      "he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\r\n",
      "intelligible gallantry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\r\n",
      "“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be\r\n",
      "a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\r\n",
      "further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\r\n",
      "attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\r\n",
      "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\r\n",
      "my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\r\n",
      "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\r\n",
      "now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\r\n",
      "was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\r\n",
      "possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\r\n",
      "were speaking of just now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\r\n",
      "living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\r\n",
      "I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\r\n",
      "and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\r\n",
      "elsewhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\r\n",
      "will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\r\n",
      "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\r\n",
      "intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\r\n",
      "conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\r\n",
      "to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\r\n",
      "it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\r\n",
      "of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\r\n",
      "less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\r\n",
      "anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\r\n",
      "I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\r\n",
      "recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\r\n",
      "of men, and that he hates me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\r\n",
      "can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\r\n",
      "ever as he expressed them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can\r\n",
      "have induced him to behave so cruelly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\r\n",
      "attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\r\n",
      "less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\r\n",
      "attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\r\n",
      "not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\r\n",
      "of preference which was often given me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\r\n",
      "him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\r\n",
      "despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\r\n",
      "descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\r\n",
      "this.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\r\n",
      "remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\r\n",
      "his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\r\n",
      "must be dreadful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly\r\n",
      "be just to him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\r\n",
      "treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\r\n",
      "father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\r\n",
      "countenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself\r\n",
      "with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,\r\n",
      "connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\r\n",
      "part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\r\n",
      "sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\r\n",
      "father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\r\n",
      "appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\r\n",
      "use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\r\n",
      "Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\r\n",
      "intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\r\n",
      "be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,\r\n",
      "and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\r\n",
      "voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\r\n",
      "be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\r\n",
      "pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better\r\n",
      "motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\r\n",
      "dishonesty I must call it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may\r\n",
      "be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has\r\n",
      "connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are\r\n",
      "none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\r\n",
      "impulses even than pride.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\r\n",
      "freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\r\n",
      "poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\r\n",
      "his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\r\n",
      "to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\r\n",
      "Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\r\n",
      "which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\r\n",
      "careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\r\n",
      "as the most attentive and best of brothers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\r\n",
      "speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\r\n",
      "proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\r\n",
      "of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\r\n",
      "nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\r\n",
      "and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\r\n",
      "home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\r\n",
      "education.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\r\n",
      "help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\r\n",
      "who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\r\n",
      "be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\r\n",
      "know Mr. Bingley?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\r\n",
      "want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\r\n",
      "his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\r\n",
      "a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\r\n",
      "pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\r\n",
      "sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\r\n",
      "for fortune and figure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\r\n",
      "the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\r\n",
      "Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\r\n",
      "made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every\r\n",
      "point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\r\n",
      "he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\r\n",
      "importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\r\n",
      "that she would not make herself uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\r\n",
      "card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I\r\n",
      "am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\r\n",
      "are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\r\n",
      "little matters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\r\n",
      "a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\r\n",
      "was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him\r\n",
      "a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\r\n",
      "notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\r\n",
      "were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\r\n",
      "connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\r\n",
      "yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\r\n",
      "believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\r\n",
      "affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\r\n",
      "self-destined for another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\r\n",
      "daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\r\n",
      "I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\r\n",
      "patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have\r\n",
      "not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\r\n",
      "her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\r\n",
      "reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\r\n",
      "she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\r\n",
      "her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\r\n",
      "nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an\r\n",
      "understanding of the first class.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\r\n",
      "they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper\r\n",
      "put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\r\n",
      "Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to\r\n",
      "everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\r\n",
      "gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\r\n",
      "think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\r\n",
      "the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\r\n",
      "as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\r\n",
      "talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\r\n",
      "fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\r\n",

      "to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\r\n",

      "they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\r\n",
      "apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\r\n",
      "aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\r\n",
      "partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\r\n",
      "him was ecstasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\r\n",
      "Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\r\n",
      "were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\r\n",

      "her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,\r\n",
      "without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\r\n",
      "immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\r\n",
      "mind; Charlotte tried to console her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\r\n",

      "in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\r\n",
      "answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\r\n",
      "she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\r\n",
      "reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding\r\n",

      "imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\r\n",
      "first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\r\n",
      "be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\r\n",
      "some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\r\n",
      "silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\r\n",
      "with:--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\r\n",
      "about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\r\n",
      "of the room, or the number of couples.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\r\n",

      "entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\r\n",
      "_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\r\n",
      "trouble of saying as little as possible.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\r\n",
      "imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\r\n",
      "similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\r\n",
      "taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\r\n",
      "something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\r\n",
      "posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\r\n",
      " said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\r\n",
      "think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must not decide on my own performance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\r\n",
      "the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\r\n",
      "walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\r\n",
      "the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\r\n",
      "been forming a new acquaintance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\r\n",
      "features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\r\n",
      "for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\r\n",
      "constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\r\n",
      "as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\r\n",
      "_retaining_ them, is less certain.”\r\n",

      "his life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\r\n",
      "that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\r\n",
      "through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\r\n",
      "his dancing and his partner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\r\n",
      "superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\r\n",
      "first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\r\n",
      "disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\r\n",
      "especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\r\n",
      "her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\r\n",
      "flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\r\n",
      "William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\r\n",
      "eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\r\n",
      "Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\r\n",
      "he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William's interruption has made\r\n",
      "me forget what we were talking of.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\r\n",
      "interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\r\n",
      "We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\r\n",
      "are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\r\n",
      "feelings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\r\n",
      "with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\r\n",
      "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\r\n",
      "questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\r\n",
      "his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\r\n",
      "give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\r\n",
      "using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\r\n",
      "always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\r\n",
      "I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\r\n",
      "cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\r\n",
      "thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\r\n",
      "the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\r\n",
      "out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\r\n",
      "thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\r\n",
      "Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,\r\n",
      "considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said\r\n",
      "Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\r\n",
      "than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can\r\n",
      "assure you, he informed me himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\r\n",
      "“Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken\r\n",
      "if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\r\n",
      "nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\r\n",
      "inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\r\n",
      "such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\r\n",
      "marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\r\n",
      "Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\r\n",
      "before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\r\n",
      "sister's, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\r\n",
      "been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\r\n",
      "you may be sure of my pardon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\r\n",
      "satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\r\n",
      "his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\r\n",
      "principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\r\n",
      "the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\r\n",
      "received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has\r\n",
      "been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\r\n",
      "satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\r\n",
      "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\r\n",
      "him _conditionally_ only.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;\r\n",
      "“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\r\n",
      "Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\r\n",
      "since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\r\n",
      "the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\r\n",
      "both gentlemen as I did before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\r\n",
      "which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\r\n",
      "delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\r\n",
      "Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\r\n",
      "in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\r\n",
      "to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\r\n",
      "partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\r\n",
      "and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\r\n",
      "to make a most important discovery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\r\n",
      "in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\r\n",
      "gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\r\n",
      "the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\r\n",
      "thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\r\n",
      "Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\r\n",
      "in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\r\n",
      "do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\r\n",
      "ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\r\n",
      "I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\r\n",
      "assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\r\n",
      "that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\r\n",
      "as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\r\n",
      "it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\r\n",
      "side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\r\n",
      "consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\r\n",
      "with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\r\n",
      "ceased speaking, replied thus:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\r\n",
      "your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\r\n",
      "understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\r\n",
      "difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\r\n",
      "and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\r\n",
      "I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\r\n",
      "the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\r\n",
      "behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to\r\n",
      "follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\r\n",
      "perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to\r\n",
      "profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\r\n",
      "guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\r\n",
      "education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\r\n",
      "lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\r\n",
      "astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\r\n",
      "his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\r\n",
      "it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\r\n",
      "words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed\r\n",
      "her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\r\n",
      "with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\r\n",
      "to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\r\n",
      "was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\r\n",
      "abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\r\n",
      "end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\r\n",
      "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\r\n",
      "reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\r\n",
      "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\r\n",
      "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\r\n",
      "certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\r\n",
      "handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\r\n",
      "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\r\n",
      "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\r\n",
      "made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\r\n",
      "that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\r\n",
      "could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\r\n",
      "endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\r\n",
      "she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\r\n",
      "venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\r\n",
      "supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\r\n",
      "placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\r\n",
      "that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\r\n",
      "openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\r\n",
      "be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\r\n",
      "seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\r\n",
      "match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\r\n",
      "three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\r\n",
      "then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\r\n",
      "Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\r\n",
      "she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\r\n",
      "daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\r\n",
      "other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\r\n",
      "able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\r\n",
      "she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\r\n",
      "necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\r\n",
      "such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\r\n",
      "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\r\n",
      "fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\r\n",
      "chance of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\r\n",
      "words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\r\n",
      "whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\r\n",
      "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\r\n",
      "mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\r\n",
      "sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\r\n",
      "nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\r\n",
      "to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\r\n",
      "so doing!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\r\n",
      "talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\r\n",
      "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\r\n",
      "glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\r\n",
      "she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\r\n",
      "convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\r\n",
      "of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\r\n",
      "steady gravity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\r\n",
      "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\r\n",
      "likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\r\n",
      "chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\r\n",
      "tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\r\n",
      "she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\r\n",
      "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\r\n",
      "entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\r\n",
      "but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\r\n",
      "exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's\r\n",
      "eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\r\n",
      "progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\r\n",
      "ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\r\n",
      "of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\r\n",
      "favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\r\n",
      "Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\r\n",
      "weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\r\n",
      "Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\r\n",
      "Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\r\n",
      "of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\r\n",
      "imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\r\n",
      "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\r\n",
      "and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do\r\n",
      "extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\r\n",
      "young ladies have time to exhibit.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\r\n",
      "her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\r\n",
      "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\r\n",
      "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\r\n",
      "compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\r\n",
      "to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\r\n",
      "to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\r\n",
      "rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make\r\n",
      "such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\r\n",
      "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\r\n",
      "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\r\n",
      "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\r\n",
      "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\r\n",
      "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,\r\n",
      "especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit\r\n",
      "him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\r\n",
      "occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\r\n",
      "family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\r\n",
      "been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\r\n",
      "smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\r\n",
      "wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\r\n",
      "and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\r\n",
      "clever, good kind of young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\r\n",
      "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\r\n",
      "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\r\n",
      "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\r\n",
      "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\r\n",
      "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\r\n",
      "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\r\n",
      "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\r\n",
      "and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\r\n",
      "gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\r\n",
      "he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\r\n",
      "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\r\n",
      "somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\r\n",
      "He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\r\n",
      "that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\r\n",
      "her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\r\n",
      "the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\r\n",
      "her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\r\n",
      "good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\r\n",
      "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\r\n",
      "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\r\n",
      "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\r\n",
      "a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\r\n",
      "an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\r\n",
      "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\r\n",
      "sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\r\n",
      "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\r\n",
      "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\r\n",
      "languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\r\n",
      "long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\r\n",
      "sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\r\n",
      "politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\r\n",
      "nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\r\n",
      "rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\r\n",
      "silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\r\n",
      "much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\r\n",
      "how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\r\n",
      "civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\r\n",
      "addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\r\n",
      "would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\r\n",
      "the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\r\n",
      "and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\r\n",
      "her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\r\n",
      "day for a short time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\r\n",
      "delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\r\n",
      "settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\r\n",
      "see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\r\n",
      "months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\r\n",
      "with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\r\n",
      "man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\r\n",
      "was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\r\n",

      "The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\r\n",
      "declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\r\n",
      "his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\r\n",
      "no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at\r\n",
      "the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\r\n",
      "observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On\r\n",
      "finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\r\n",
      "soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\r\n",
      "when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\r\n",
      "course of this morning?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy\r\n",
      "will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I\r\n",
      "want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening\r\n",
      "away, when Elizabeth called out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\r\n",
      "me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\r\n",
      "going away myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to\r\n",
      "escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.\r\n",
      "Collins.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\r\n",
      "consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\r\n",
      "over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to\r\n",
      "conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between\r\n",
      "distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\r\n",
      "they were gone, Mr. Collins began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\r\n",
      "doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\r\n",
      "would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\r\n",
      "unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\r\n",
      "mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the\r\n",
      "purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\r\n",
      "dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\r\n",
      "soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of\r\n",
      "my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\r\n",
      "subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for\r\n",
      "marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\r\n",
      "of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\r\n",
      "with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could\r\n",
      "not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,\r\n",
      "and he continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\r\n",
      "every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\r\n",
      "of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\r\n",
      "add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\r\n",
      "to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\r\n",
      "recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\r\n",
      "patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\r\n",
      "too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\r\n",
      "left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\r\n",
      "arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\r\n",
      "must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\r\n",
      "a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\r\n",
      "useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\r\n",
      "income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\r\n",
      "you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\r\n",
      "way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\r\n",
      "and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\r\n",
      "advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\r\n",
      "anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\r\n",
      "acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\r\n",
      "respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\r\n",
      "intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\r\n",
      "were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\r\n",
      "can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\r\n",
      "being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\r\n",
      "father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\r\n",
      "myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\r\n",
      "the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\r\n",
      "event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\r\n",
      "be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\r\n",
      "I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\r\n",
      "remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\r\n",
      "violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\r\n",
      "shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\r\n",
      "aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\r\n",
      "in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's\r\n",
      "decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\r\n",
      "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\r\n",
      "no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\r\n",
      "answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\r\n",
      "the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\r\n",
      "your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to\r\n",
      "decline them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\r\n",
      "hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\r\n",
      "man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\r\n",
      "favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\r\n",
      "third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\r\n",
      "said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather\r\n",
      "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\r\n",
      "one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\r\n",
      "daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\r\n",
      "time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\r\n",
      "happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\r\n",
      "could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\r\n",
      "am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\r\n",
      "situation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins\r\n",
      "very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\r\n",
      "disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of\r\n",
      "seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\r\n",
      "modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\r\n",
      "must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\r\n",
      "of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\r\n",
      "refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\r\n",
      "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\r\n",
      "feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\r\n",
      "estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\r\n",
      "be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she\r\n",
      "thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\r\n",
      "addressed her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\r\n",
      "shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\r\n",
      "me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\r\n",
      "know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\r\n",
      "the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\r\n",
      "encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\r\n",
      "female character.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me\r\n",
      "exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\r\n",
      "of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\r\n",
      "to convince you of its being one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\r\n",
      "refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\r\n",
      "believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\r\n",
      "unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\r\n",
      "be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\r\n",
      "with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\r\n",
      "circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\r\n",
      "consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\r\n",
      "means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\r\n",
      "portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\r\n",
      "the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\r\n",
      "therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\r\n",
      "I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\r\n",
      "suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\r\n",
      "of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\r\n",
      "rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\r\n",
      "again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\r\n",
      "to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\r\n",
      "forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\r\n",
      "female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\r\n",
      "the truth from her heart.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\r\n",
      "gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\r\n",
      "authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\r\n",
      "being acceptable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make\r\n",
      "no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if\r\n",
      "he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\r\n",
      "encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\r\n",
      "in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\r\n",
      "not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\r\n",

      "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\r\n",
      "successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\r\n",
      "to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open\r\n",
      "the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\r\n",
      "entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\r\n",
      "warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\r\n",
      "received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\r\n",
      "proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\r\n",
      "of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\r\n",
      "refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\r\n",
      "from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\r\n",
      "him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\r\n",
      "and could not help saying so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\r\n",
      "brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very\r\n",
      "headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will\r\n",
      "_make_ her know it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\r\n",
      "altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\r\n",
      "naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\r\n",
      "actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not\r\n",
      "to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\r\n",
      "temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is\r\n",
      "only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\r\n",
      "good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\r\n",
      "we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\r\n",

      "do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I have, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, or I will never see her again.”\r\n",

      "again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\r\n",
      "if you _do_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\r\n",
      "coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane\r\n",
      "in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\r\n",
      "interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\r\n",
      "sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\r\n",
      "varied, however, her determination never did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\r\n",
      "He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin\r\n",
      "could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\r\n",
      "way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\r\n",
      "deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\r\n",
      "the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\r\n",
      "her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\r\n",
      "fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\r\n",
      "made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\r\n",
      "who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\r\n",
      "breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\r\n",
      "the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\r\n",
      "her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\r\n",
      "family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone,\r\n",
      "“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,\r\n",
      "nobody feels for my poor nerves.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned\r\n",
      "as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\r\n",
      "she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it\r\n",
      "into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\r\n",
      "you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\r\n",
      "to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep\r\n",
      "you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\r\n",
      "you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\r\n",
      "and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\r\n",
      "to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\r\n",
      "to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\r\n",
      "no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\r\n",
      "is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\r\n",
      "any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the\r\n",
      "irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of\r\n",

      "herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\r\n",
      "curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\r\n",

      "and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt\r\n",
      "of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;\r\n",
      "for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as\r\n",
      "when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\r\n",
      "estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect\r\n",
      "to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to\r\n",
      "your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\r\n",
      "compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my\r\n",
      "behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\r\n",
      "dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all\r\n",
      "liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\r\n",

      "attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her\r\n",
      "mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly\r\n",
      "expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\r\n",
      "but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke\r\n",

      "bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\r\n",
      "them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to\r\n",
      "her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\r\n",

      "Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw\r\n",

      "herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual\r\n",

      "on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\r\n",
      "sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\r\n",
      "invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,\r\n",

      "expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\r\n",

      "in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\r\n",
      "I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\r\n",

      "degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\r\n",

      "to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\r\n",
      "lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\r\n",

      "conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\r\n",

      "His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\r\n",

      "Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\r\n",
      "should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,\r\n",
      "were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\r\n",
      "of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\r\n",
      "done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\r\n",
      "dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\r\n",
      "gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\r\n",
      "in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\r\n",
      "nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\r\n",
      "be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\r\n",
      "either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\r\n",
      "the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\r\n",

      "was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\r\n",
      "she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,\r\n",

      "shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\r\n",
      "to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\r\n",
      "when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\r\n",
      "passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\r\n",
      "dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\r\n",
      "curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\r\n",
      "questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\r\n",
      "at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\r\n",
      "so speedy a return, immediately said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my\r\n",
      "good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\r\n",
      "offending your patroness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\r\n",
      "for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\r\n",
      "material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\r\n",
      "displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\r\n",
      "again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\r\n",
      "and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\r\n",
      "affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\r\n",
      "from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\r\n",
      "regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\r\n",
      "my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\r\n",
      "take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\r\n",
      "cousin Elizabeth.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\r\n",
      "surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\r\n",
      "understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\r\n",
      "younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\r\n",
      "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\r\n",
      "a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\r\n",
      "means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\r\n",
      "and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\r\n",
      "agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\r\n",
      "kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\r\n",
      "private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\r\n",
      "friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\r\n",
      "that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\r\n",
      "possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\r\n",
      "consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\r\n",
      "she could not help crying out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\r\n",
      "story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\r\n",
      "reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\r\n",
      "her composure, and calmly replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\r\n",
      "that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\r\n",
      "because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\r\n",
      "for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\r\n",
      "their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\r\n",
      "all imaginable happiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,\r\n",
      "very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\r\n",
      "you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\r\n",
      "satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never\r\n",
      "was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\r\n",
      "character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\r\n",
      "chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\r\n",
      "entering the marriage state.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,\r\n",
      "they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\r\n",
      "longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\r\n",
      "It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\r\n",
      "unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\r\n",
      "of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\r\n",
      "accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was\r\n",
      "not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\r\n",
      "that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\r\n",
      "feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\r\n",
      "most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\r\n",
      "and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\r\n",
      "was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\r\n",

      "announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\r\n",
      "and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\r\n",

      "incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,\r\n",

      "endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters\r\n",
      "by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\r\n",
      "was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\r\n",

      "had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be\r\n",

      "inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\r\n",
      "herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\r\n",
      "points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\r\n",
      "console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\r\n",

      "no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\r\n",
      "disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\r\n",
      "sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\r\n",

      "their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\r\n",
      "twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\r\n",
      "his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\r\n",
      "rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\r\n",
      "of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\r\n",

      "to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\r\n",

      "he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\r\n",

      "to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\r\n",
      "and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\r\n",
      "while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\r\n",
      "most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\r\n",

      "she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\r\n",
      "dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\r\n",
      "frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\r\n",

      "impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\r\n",
      "did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\r\n",

      "and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\r\n",
      "from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\r\n",
      "him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\r\n",
      "to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\r\n",

      "Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\r\n",
      "anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\r\n",
      "and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight\r\n",
      "of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\r\n",
      "regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\r\n",
      "them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\r\n",

      "for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's\r\n",
      "assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\r\n",
      "credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\r\n",

      "could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\r\n",
      "of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\r\n",
      "of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\r\n",
      "to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,\r\n",
      "been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\r\n",
      "whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as\r\n",
      "she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,\r\n",
      "on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\r\n",
      "could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really\r\n",

      "privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\r\n",

      "out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,\r\n",
      "unless he really comes to see her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\r\n",
      "friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such\r\n",
      "a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\r\n",
      "perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\r\n",
      "would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\r\n",

      "withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\r\n",

      "hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\r\n",

      "description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of\r\n",

      "so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the\r\n",
      "necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\r\n",

      "“_That_ you certainly shall.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "come to Hunsford.”\r\n",

      "visit.\r\n",

      "the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their\r\n",
      "correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that\r\n",
      "it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\r\n",
      "address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\r\n",
      "and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\r\n",
      "sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters\r\n",
      "were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\r\n",
      "curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\r\n",
      "like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\r\n",
      "be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\r\n",
      "expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\r\n",
      "wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\r\n",
      "which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\r\n",
      "roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most\r\n",
      "friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and\r\n",
      "Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\r\n",
      "for her own visit there to know the rest.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\r\n",
      "generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or\r\n",
      "hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\r\n",
      "her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\r\n",
      "lost.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the\r\n",
      "town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\r\n",
      "“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very\r\n",
      "glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\r\n",
      "to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached\r\n",
      "her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\r\n",
      "engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\r\n",
      "Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was\r\n",
      "not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\r\n",
      "see them soon here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\r\n",
      "accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\r\n",
      "persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\r\n",
      "blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning\r\n",
      "for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\r\n",
      "visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\r\n",
      "the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\r\n",
      "longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\r\n",
      "prove what she felt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\r\n",
      "better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\r\n",
      "entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,\r\n",
      "though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I\r\n",
      "still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was\r\n",
      "as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for\r\n",
      "wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\r\n",
      "happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\r\n",
      "return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\r\n",
      "receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\r\n",
      "she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\r\n",
      "calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\r\n",
      "in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\r\n",
      "perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\r\n",
      "though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\r\n",
      "as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\r\n",
      "her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\r\n",
      "wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\r\n",
      "cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\r\n",
      "this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\r\n",
      "account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\r\n",
      "his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\r\n",
      "amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,\r\n",
      "because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\r\n",
      "He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said\r\n",
      "herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she\r\n",
      "wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I\r\n",
      "cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\r\n",
      "be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\r\n",
      "in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\r\n",
      "and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\r\n",
      "invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\r\n",
      "soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield\r\n",
      "again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better\r\n",
      "not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts\r\n",
      "from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\r\n",

      "This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she\r\n",
      "considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\r\n",
      "All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\r\n",
      "even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on\r\n",
      "every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\r\n",
      "advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\r\n",

      "concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\r\n",
      "had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\r\n",
      "herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\r\n",
      "he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\r\n",
      "see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\r\n",
      "Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\r\n",
      "with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\r\n",
      "permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\r\n",
      "remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\r\n",
      "agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\r\n",
      "in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\r\n",
      "Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\r\n",
      "suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\r\n",

      "and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and\r\n",
      "wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\r\n",
      "towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\r\n",
      "out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to\r\n",

      "as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's\r\n",
      "door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\r\n",
      "they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\r\n",
      "looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\r\n",
      "lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\r\n",
      "whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\r\n",
      "wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\r\n",
      "her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\r\n",
      "road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\r\n",
      "everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\r\n",
      "appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\r\n",
      "led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\r\n",
      "the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\r\n",
      "at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\r\n",
      "liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\r\n",
      "coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\r\n",
      "instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;\r\n",
      "his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\r\n",
      "minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\r\n",
      "family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\r\n",
      "neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they\r\n",
      "were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\r\n",
      "formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's\r\n",
      "offers of refreshment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\r\n",
      "in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\r\n",
      "aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,\r\n",
      "as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But\r\n",
      "though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\r\n",
      "gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at\r\n",
      "her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\r\n",
      "When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\r\n",
      "ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her\r\n",
      "eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but\r\n",
      "in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to\r\n",
      "admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to\r\n",
      "the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\r\n",
      "happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\r\n",
      "garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\r\n",
      "which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\r\n",
      "respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\r\n",
      "with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\r\n",
      "owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\r\n",
      "through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\r\n",
      "interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\r\n",
      "with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\r\n",
      "fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\r\n",
      "the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\r\n",
      "the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the\r\n",
      "prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\r\n",
      "the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\r\n",
      "modern building, well situated on rising ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\r\n",
      "but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\r\n",
      "frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\r\n",
      "took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\r\n",
      "probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's\r\n",
      "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\r\n",
      "was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\r\n",
      "Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\r\n",
      "forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\r\n",
      "Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\r\n",
      "forgotten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\r\n",
      "was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\r\n",
      "in, observed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\r\n",
      "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\r\n",
      "be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\r\n",
      "doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\r\n",
      "when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\r\n",
      "will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\r\n",
      "honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\r\n",
      "charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\r\n",
      "to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\r\n",
      "_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added\r\n",
      "Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\r\n",
      "woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\r\n",
      "and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\r\n",
      "Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\r\n",
      "and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\r\n",
      "was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit\r\n",
      "would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\r\n",
      "interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\r\n",
      "Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\r\n",
      "for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\r\n",
      "confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\r\n",
      "up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\r\n",
      "the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\r\n",
      "agitation, cried out--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\r\n",
      "there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\r\n",
      "haste, and come down this moment.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\r\n",
      "and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\r\n",
      "quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\r\n",
      "garden gate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs\r\n",
      "were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\r\n",
      "daughter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not\r\n",
      "Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\r\n",
      "the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\r\n",
      "creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\r\n",
      "Why does she not come in?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\r\n",
      "when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She\r\n",
      "looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\r\n",
      "make him a very proper wife.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\r\n",
      "with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was\r\n",
      "stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\r\n",
      "before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\r\n",
      "way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\r\n",
      "the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\r\n",
      "girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\r\n",
      "Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\r\n",
      "to dine at Rosings the next day.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\r\n",
      "The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\r\n",
      "visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\r\n",
      "wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\r\n",
      "of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\r\n",
      "her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at\r\n",
      "Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it\r\n",
      "would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who\r\n",
      "could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there\r\n",
      "(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\r\n",
      "after your arrival!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\r\n",
      "“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\r\n",
      "my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\r\n",
      "instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\r\n",
      "visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\r\n",
      "they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\r\n",
      "so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\r\n",
      "becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\r\n",
      "whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\r\n",
      "for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\r\n",
      "for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\r\n",
      "preserved.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\r\n",
      "doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\r\n",
      "objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\r\n",
      "her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\r\n",
      "who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\r\n",
      "introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\r\n",
      "to his presentation at St. James's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\r\n",
      "mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\r\n",
      "raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\r\n",
      "slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\r\n",
      "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\r\n",
      "cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every\r\n",
      "moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\r\n",
      "miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\r\n",
      "she could witness without trepidation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\r\n",
      "rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\r\n",
      "followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\r\n",
      "with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\r\n",
      "settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\r\n",
      "be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\r\n",
      "apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\r\n",
      "awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\r\n",
      "enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\r\n",
      "and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\r\n",
      "of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\r\n",
      "quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\r\n",
      "composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\r\n",
      "features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\r\n",
      "conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\r\n",
      "visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\r\n",
      "silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\r\n",
      "as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\r\n",
      "believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\r\n",
      "she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\r\n",
      "daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her\r\n",
      "being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\r\n",
      "likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\r\n",
      "features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\r\n",
      "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\r\n",
      "there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\r\n",
      "to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\r\n",
      "her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\r\n",
      "admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\r\n",
      "and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\r\n",
      "looking at in the summer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\r\n",
      "all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\r\n",
      "likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\r\n",
      "ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\r\n",
      "nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\r\n",
      "alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\r\n",
      "William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\r\n",
      "said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\r\n",
      "But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\r\n",
      "gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\r\n",
      "a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\r\n",
      "was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\r\n",
      "between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\r\n",
      "listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\r\n",
      "dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\r\n",
      "Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\r\n",
      "she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\r\n",
      "gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\r\n",
      "be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\r\n",
      "intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\r\n",
      "subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\r\n",
      "have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic\r\n",
      "concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\r\n",
      "to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\r\n",
      "regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\r\n",
      "care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\r\n",
      "beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\r\n",
      "occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\r\n",
      "with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\r\n",
      "the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\r\n",
      "pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\r\n",
      "she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\r\n",
      "them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\r\n",
      "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\r\n",
      "her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of\r\n",
      "her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\r\n",
      "observed,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\r\n",
      "sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\r\n",
      "occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\r\n",
      "necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\r\n",
      "instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\r\n",
      "some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One of them does.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\r\n",
      "Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\r\n",
      "you draw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, none of you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\r\n",
      "should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has your governess left you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We never had any governess.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\r\n",
      "without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\r\n",
      "have been quite a slave to your education.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been\r\n",
      "the case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you\r\n",
      "must have been neglected.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\r\n",
      "wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\r\n",
      "read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\r\n",
      "idle, certainly might.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\r\n",
      "known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\r\n",
      "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\r\n",
      "and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\r\n",
      "wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\r\n",
      "way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\r\n",
      "it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\r\n",
      "who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\r\n",
      "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's\r\n",
      "calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your\r\n",
      "younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma'am, all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\r\n",
      "younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters\r\n",
      "must be very young?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\r\n",
      "much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\r\n",
      "younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\r\n",
      "amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\r\n",
      "marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\r\n",
      "as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\r\n",
      "not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\r\n",
      "for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\r\n",
      "ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\r\n",
      "and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\r\n",
      "dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\r\n",

      "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables\r\n",
      "were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\r\n",
      "down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\r\n",
      "two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\r\n",
      "party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\r\n",
      "uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\r\n",
      "expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\r\n",
      "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\r\n",
      "other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\r\n",
      "of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\r\n",
      "was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\r\n",
      "for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\r\n",
      "Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\r\n",
      "and noble names.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\r\n",
      "the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\r\n",
      "gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\r\n",
      "round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\r\n",
      "to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by\r\n",
      "the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\r\n",
      "Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon\r\n",
      "as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin\r\n",
      "to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\r\n",
      "Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\r\n",
      "commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise\r\n",
      "into his own hands.\r\n",

      "Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\r\n",
      "enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,\r\n",
      "and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\r\n",
      "often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\r\n",
      "morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\r\n",
      "when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\r\n",
      "and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\r\n",
      "cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast\r\n",
      "and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in\r\n",
      "reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,\r\n",
      "which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\r\n",
      "the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\r\n",
      "more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\r\n",
      "reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\r\n",
      "much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\r\n",
      "she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\r\n",
      "were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\r\n",
      "along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\r\n",
      "which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\r\n",
      "almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and\r\n",
      "had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\r\n",
      "prevailed upon to get out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\r\n",
      "not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\r\n",
      "and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\r\n",
      "to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\r\n",
      "hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\r\n",
      "and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\r\n",
      "these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\r\n",
      "and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\r\n",
      "of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\r\n",
      "accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\r\n",
      "out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\r\n",
      "commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate\r\n",
      "in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her\r\n",
      "by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\r\n",
      "be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\r\n",
      "village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\r\n",
      "them into harmony and plenty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\r\n",
      "and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\r\n",
      "card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\r\n",
      "of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\r\n",
      "in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,\r\n",
      "however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\r\n",
      "comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\r\n",
      "Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\r\n",
      "often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\r\n",
      "frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\r\n",
      "along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\r\n",
      "a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\r\n",
      "where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\r\n",
      "Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\r\n",
      "addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\r\n",
      "important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\r\n",
      "expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\r\n",
      "many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\r\n",
      "furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\r\n",
      "she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\r\n",
      "were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\r\n",
      "destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\r\n",
      "satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\r\n",
      "seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\r\n",
      "Miss Lucas and herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\r\n",
      "the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\r\n",
      "in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\r\n",
      "bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\r\n",
      "intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\r\n",
      "respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\r\n",
      "his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\r\n",
      "them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\r\n",
      "into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\r\n",
      "never have come so soon to wait upon me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\r\n",
      "before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\r\n",
      "afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\r\n",
      "who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\r\n",
      "address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\r\n",
      "used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\r\n",
      "reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\r\n",
      "friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\r\n",
      "curtseyed to him without saying a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\r\n",
      "readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\r\n",
      "his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\r\n",
      "garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\r\n",
      "At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\r\n",
      "Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\r\n",
      "way, and after a moment's pause, added:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\r\n",
      "happened to see her there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\r\n",
      "whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between\r\n",
      "the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he\r\n",
      "answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\r\n",

      "at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\r\n",

      "great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are\r\n",
      "not your own.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\r\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\r\n",
      "me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\r\n",
      "in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\r\n",
      "of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\r\n",
      "credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\r\n",
      "that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\r\n",
      "say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\r\n",
      "things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\r\n",

      "was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\r\n",
      "only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\r\n",

      "introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "concerns, as I often see done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the\r\n",
      "masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same\r\n",
      "force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\r\n",
      "have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\r\n",
      "calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\r\n",
      "and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\r\n",
      "them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\r\n",
      "on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\r\n",
      "much to anybody, went away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was\r\n",

      "conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\r\n",
      "the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\r\n",
      "from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\r\n",
      "was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\r\n",
      "always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\r\n",
      "pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\r\n",
      "two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\r\n",
      "almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\r\n",
      "separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\r\n",
      "aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\r\n",
      "had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\r\n",
      "him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\r\n",
      "being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\r\n",
      "former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\r\n",
      "there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\r\n",
      "she believed he might have the best informed mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\r\n",
      "to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\r\n",
      "ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\r\n",
      "it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\r\n",
      "to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\r\n",
      "animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\r\n",
      "Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\r\n",
      "generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\r\n",
      "her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\r\n",
      "of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\r\n",
      "seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\r\n",
      "Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\r\n",
      "certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\r\n",
      "look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\r\n",
      "doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\r\n",
      "seemed nothing but absence of mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\r\n",
      "being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\r\n",
      "Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\r\n",
      "raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\r\n",
      "opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\r\n",
      "vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\r\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\r\n",
      "certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\r\n",
      "to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\r\n",
      "in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\r\n",

      "unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\r\n",
      "mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to\r\n",
      "prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\r\n",
      "it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\r\n",
      "therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\r\n",
      "wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\r\n",
      "not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\r\n",
      "but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\r\n",
      "never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\r\n",
      "or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\r\n",

      "her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\r\n",
      "opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of\r\n",
      "Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\r\n",
      "expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\r\n",
      "_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\r\n",
      "Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\r\n",
      "mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed\r\n",
      "her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\r\n",

      "spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw\r\n",
      "on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the\r\n",
      "letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally\r\n",
      "do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are\r\n",
      "you going much farther?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\r\n",
      "arranges the business just as he pleases.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\r\n",
      "pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\r\n",
      "more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\r\n",
      "“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it\r\n",
      "than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\r\n",
      "feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\r\n",
      "dependence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\r\n",
      "either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\r\n",
      "dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\r\n",
      "wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\r\n",
      "experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\r\n",
      "weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where\r\n",
      "they like.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\r\n",
      "do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many\r\n",
      "in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\r\n",
      "money.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the\r\n",
      "idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what\r\n",
      "is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\r\n",
      "very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\r\n",
      "a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\r\n",
      "she soon afterwards said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\r\n",
      "having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\r\n",
      "lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\r\n",
      "for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\r\n",
      "likes with her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must\r\n",
      "divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\r\n",
      "charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\r\n",
      "little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\r\n",
      "may like to have her own way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\r\n",
      "in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\r\n",
      "give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\r\n",
      "got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\r\n",
      "say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\r\n",
      "very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\r\n",
      "is a great friend of Darcy's.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\r\n",
      "Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\r\n",
      "those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\r\n",
      "our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\r\n",
      "him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\r\n",
      "Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\r\n",
      "because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an\r\n",
      "unpleasant thing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\r\n",
      "Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\r\n",
      "on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\r\n",
      "imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\r\n",
      "particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\r\n",
      "him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\r\n",
      "knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\r\n",
      "lady.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\r\n",
      "only told me what I have now told you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\r\n",
      "indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\r\n",
      "was so thoughtful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\r\n",
      "cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\r\n",
      "friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to\r\n",
      "determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\r\n",
      "But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\r\n",
      "particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\r\n",
      "that there was much affection in the case.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a\r\n",
      "lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\r\n",
      "of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and\r\n",
      "therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent\r\n",
      "matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\r\n",
      "as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\r\n",
      "of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\r\n",
      "people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\r\n",
      "could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\r\n",
      "such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\r\n",
      "taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\r\n",
      "always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\r\n",
      "of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\r\n",
      "the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\r\n",
      "suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while\r\n",
      "every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the\r\n",
      "world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel\r\n",
      "Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her\r\n",
      "having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\r\n",
      "business in London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\r\n",
      "objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding\r\n",
      "excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither\r\n",
      "could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\r\n",
      "peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and\r\n",
      "respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of\r\n",
      "her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow\r\n",
      "that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\r\n",
      "pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of\r\n",
      "importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;\r\n",
      "and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed\r\n",
      "by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\r\n",
      "Bingley for his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\r\n",
      "headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to\r\n",
      "her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\r\n",
      "cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\r\n",
      "seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much\r\n",
      "as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\r\n",
      "could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\r\n",
      "displeased by her staying at home.\r\n",

      "When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself\r\n",
      "as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\r\n",
      "examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\r\n",
      "being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\r\n",
      "revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\r\n",
      "But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\r\n",

      "proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\r\n",
      "disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\r\n",
      "noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\r\n",
      "attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\r\n",
      "shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her\r\n",
      "a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation\r\n",
      "to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the\r\n",
      "next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should\r\n",
      "herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of\r\n",
      "her spirits, by all that affection could do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that\r\n",
      "his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\r\n",
      "that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\r\n",

      "being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\r\n",
      "the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\r\n",
      "But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\r\n",
      "affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\r\n",
      "room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\r\n",
      "health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\r\n",
      "She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\r\n",
      "then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\r\n",
      "said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\r\n",
      "in an agitated manner, and thus began:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\r\n",
      "repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\r\n",
      "doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;\r\n",
      "and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,\r\n",
      "immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\r\n",
      "those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\r\n",
      "subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\r\n",
      "its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\r\n",
      "opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\r\n",
      "the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\r\n",
      "suit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\r\n",
      "the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\r\n",
      "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\r\n",
      "receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\r\n",
      "lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\r\n",
      "answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\r\n",
      "representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite\r\n",
      "of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\r\n",
      "expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\r\n",
      "his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\r\n",
      "of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\r\n",
      "his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could\r\n",
      "only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\r\n",
      "cheeks, and she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\r\n",
      "express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\r\n",
      "unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\r\n",
      "be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\r\n",
      "cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\r\n",
      "bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\r\n",
      "anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\r\n",
      "of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\r\n",
      "the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\r\n",
      "overcoming it after this explanation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed\r\n",
      "on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\r\n",
      "surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance\r\n",
      "of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\r\n",
      "appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\r\n",
      "himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\r\n",
      "dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\r\n",
      "I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\r\n",
      "civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire\r\n",
      "of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\r\n",
      "against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\r\n",
      "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\r\n",
      "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against\r\n",
      "you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you\r\n",
      "think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\r\n",
      "been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\r\n",
      "beloved sister?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\r\n",
      "was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\r\n",
      "continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\r\n",
      "excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\r\n",
      "you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\r\n",
      "of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\r\n",
      "world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\r\n",
      "disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\r\n",
      "kind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\r\n",
      "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\r\n",
      "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying\r\n",
      "that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\r\n",
      "sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\r\n",
      "kinder than towards myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\r\n",
      "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\r\n",
      "is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\r\n",
      "decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\r\n",
      "many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\r\n",
      "say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\r\n",
      "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,” said Darcy,\r\n",
      "in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\r\n",
      "interest in him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes\r\n",
      "have been great indeed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced\r\n",
      "him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have\r\n",
      "withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for\r\n",
      "him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence\r\n",
      "which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!\r\n",
      "and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and\r\n",
      "ridicule.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\r\n",
      "“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!\r\n",
      "I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\r\n",
      "calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in\r\n",
      "his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been\r\n",
      "overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\r\n",
      "scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\r\n",
      "bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\r\n",
      "policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\r\n",
      "my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\r\n",
      "reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\r\n",
      "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\r\n",
      "just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\r\n",
      "connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\r\n",
      "condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\r\n",
      "the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\r\n",
      "declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern\r\n",
      "which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\r\n",
      "gentlemanlike manner.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\r\n",
      "would have tempted me to accept it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\r\n",
      "expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\r\n",
      "my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\r\n",
      "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\r\n",
      "the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\r\n",
      "disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\r\n",
      "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\r\n",
      "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\r\n",
      "feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\r\n",
      "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\r\n",
      "wishes for your health and happiness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\r\n",
      "the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\r\n",
      "to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\r\n",
      "half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\r\n",
      "was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\r\n",
      "marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\r\n",
      "so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\r\n",
      "all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying\r\n",
      "her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\r\n",
      "own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\r\n",
      "unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\r\n",
      "pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\r\n",
      "Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\r\n",
      "not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\r\n",
      "Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\r\n",
      "overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\r\n",
      "a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\r\n",
      "sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\r\n",
      "encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\r\n",

      "Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\r\n",
      "which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\r\n",
      "surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\r\n",
      "else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\r\n",
      "breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\r\n",
      "directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\r\n",
      "sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\r\n",
      "she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\r\n",
      "park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\r\n",
      "of the gates into the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\r\n",
      "made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\r\n",
      "verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\r\n",
      "when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\r\n",
      "edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\r\n",
      "near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\r\n",
      "her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\r\n",
      "in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\r\n",
      "gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\r\n",
      "which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\r\n",
      "“I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\r\n",
      "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a\r\n",
      "slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\r\n",
      "perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\r\n",
      "quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\r\n",
      "full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\r\n",
      "from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\r\n",
      "of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\r\n",
      "offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\r\n",
      "intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\r\n",
      "which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\r\n",
      "effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\r\n",
      "should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\r\n",
      "and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\r\n",
      "your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\r\n",
      "demand it of your justice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\r\n",
      "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\r\n",
      "that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\r\n",
      "from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\r\n",
      "claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\r\n",

      "its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\r\n",
      "persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\r\n",
      "bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\r\n",
      "night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\r\n",
      "to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\r\n",
      "and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\r\n",
      "is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\r\n",
      "may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\r\n",
      "must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\r\n",

      "“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\r\n",
      "others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\r\n",
      "woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\r\n",
      "at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\r\n",
      "attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\r\n",
      "had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\r\n",
      "William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\r\n",
      "your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\r\n",
      "He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\r\n",
      "be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour\r\n",
      "attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\r\n",
      "watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\r\n",
      "but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\r\n",
      "from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\r\n",
      "with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\r\n",
      "sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\r\n",
      "in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\r\n",
      "probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\r\n",
      "pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\r\n",
      "scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and\r\n",
      "air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\r\n",
      "that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\r\n",
      "easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\r\n",
      "certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions\r\n",
      "are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe\r\n",
      "her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial\r\n",
      "conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the\r\n",
      "marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have\r\n",
      "the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of\r\n",
      "connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But\r\n",
      "there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still\r\n",
      "existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had\r\n",
      "myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\r\n",
      "me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your\r\n",
      "mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that\r\n",
      "total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by\r\n",
      "herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your\r\n",
      "father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern\r\n",
      "for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\r\n",
      "representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to\r\n",
      "have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,\r\n",
      "is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than\r\n",
      "it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say\r\n",
      "farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties\r\n",
      "was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\r\n",
      "me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\r\n",
      "connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as\r\n",
      "you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness\r\n",
      "had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was\r\n",
      "soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\r\n",
      "detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\r\n",
      "London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office\r\n",
      "of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\r\n",
      "described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance\r\n",
      "might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\r\n",
      "that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\r\n",
      "seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\r\n",
      "sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\r\n",
      "affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\r\n",
      "natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\r\n",
      "own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\r\n",
      "no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\r\n",
      "Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\r\n",
      "work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\r\n",
      "is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\r\n",
      "reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\r\n",
      "measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in\r\n",
      "town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her\r\n",
      "brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without\r\n",
      "ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\r\n",
      "enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\r\n",
      "concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\r\n",
      "was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\r\n",
      "other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it\r\n",
      "was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to\r\n",
      "you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",

      "connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I\r\n",

      "years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good\r\n",
      "conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to\r\n",
      "be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his\r\n",
      "kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\r\n",
      "school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his\r\n",
      "own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\r\n",
      "been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only\r\n",
      "fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he\r\n",
      "had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be\r\n",
      "his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is\r\n",
      "many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different\r\n",
      "manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was\r\n",
      "careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\r\n",
      "the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,\r\n",
      "and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree\r\n",
      "you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham\r\n",

      "Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly\r\n",
      "recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner\r\n",
      "that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\r\n",
      "valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\r\n",
      "was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\r\n",
      "survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\r\n",
      "wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,\r\n",
      "he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\r\n",
      "immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\r\n",
      "could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\r\n",
      "law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\r\n",
      "be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\r\n",
      "him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\r\n",
      "his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\r\n",
      "business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance\r\n",
      "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\r\n",
      "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\r\n",
      "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\r\n",
      "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\r\n",
      "lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\r\n",
      "from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\r\n",
      "For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\r\n",
      "incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\r\n",
      "me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\r\n",
      "me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\r\n",
      "had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\r\n",
      "resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\r\n",
      "question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\r\n",
      "well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\r\n",
      "have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame\r\n",
      "me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\r\n",
      "repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\r\n",
      "his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\r\n",
      "to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\r\n",
      "appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\r\n",
      "last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,\r\n",
      "and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold\r\n",
      "to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your\r\n",
      "secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to\r\n",
      "the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\r\n",
      "About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\r\n",
      "for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided\r\n",
      "over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by\r\n",
      "design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and\r\n",
      "by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\r\n",
      "whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to\r\n",
      "her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and\r\n",
      "to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\r\n",
      "excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed\r\n",
      "the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\r\n",
      "before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\r\n",
      "idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\r\n",
      "a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\r\n",
      "how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented\r\n",
      "any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\r\n",
      "immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\r\n",
      "Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which\r\n",
      "is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\r\n",
      "revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have\r\n",

      "“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have\r\n",

      "impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\r\n",
      "other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\r\n",

      "particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\r\n",
      "to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\r\n",

      "the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\r\n",
      "impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\r\n",
      "little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read\r\n",

      "never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had\r\n",
      "established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried\r\n",

      "family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\r\n",
      "herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;\r\n",
      "that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's\r\n",
      "character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\r\n",
      "always prevent his exposing the son.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\r\n",
      "His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\r\n",
      "hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\r\n",
      "the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\r\n",
      "His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\r\n",
      "either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\r\n",
      "his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\r\n",
      "incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\r\n",
      "and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\r\n",
      "but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\r\n",
      "asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\r\n",
      "were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\r\n",
      "acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\r\n",
      "together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\r\n",
      "that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\r\n",
      "of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was\r\n",
      "esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\r\n",
      "brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\r\n",
      "sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his\r\n",
      "actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\r\n",
      "everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\r\n",
      "that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\r\n",
      "as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\r\n",

      "absurd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified\r\n",
      "my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this\r\n",
      "discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could\r\n",
      "not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my\r\n",
      "folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\r\n",
      "of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\r\n",

      "which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation\r\n",
      "_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely\r\n",
      "different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\r\n",
      "credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to\r\n",
      "give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her\r\n",
      "sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's\r\n",
      "opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\r\n",

      "of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\r\n",
      "for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as\r\n",
      "having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\r\n",
      "disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\r\n",
      "than on hers.\r\n",

      "self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered\r\n",
      "that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\r\n",
      "relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\r\n",
      "by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\r\n",

      "so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made\r\n",
      "her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish\r\n",

      "an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\r\n",
      "till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern\r\n",

      "the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\r\n",
      "evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\r\n",
      "she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\r\n",

      "had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved\r\n",
      "very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\r\n",
      "luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated\r\n",
      "you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never\r\n",
      "should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then\r\n",
      "we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that\r\n",

      "not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\r\n",
      "There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.\r\n",
      "Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\r\n",
      "comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond\r\n",

      "She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton\r\n",
      "scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\r\n",
      "frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\r\n",
      "father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\r\n",
      "at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\r\n",

      "who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\r\n",
      "so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here\r\n",
      "collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though\r\n",

      "with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\r\n",

      "of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\r\n",
      "her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\r\n",
      "will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\r\n",
      "that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\r\n",

      "object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\r\n",

      "them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret\r\n",

      "stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\r\n",
      "and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\r\n",
      "saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\r\n",
      "officers at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such\r\n",

      "conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\r\n",

      "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\r\n",
      "frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\r\n",
      "well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\r\n",
      "learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted\r\n",
      "her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\r\n",
      "behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\r\n",
      "for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\r\n",
      "had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\r\n",
      "what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\r\n",
      "finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\r\n",
      "gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\r\n",
      "reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\r\n",
      "cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\r\n",
      "and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\r\n",
      "disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\r\n",
      "inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\r\n",
      "mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\r\n",
      "weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\r\n",
      "recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\r\n",
      "him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\r\n",
      "asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\r\n",
      "With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nearly three weeks.”\r\n",

      "“His manners are very different from his cousin's.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And\r\n",
      "pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is\r\n",
      "it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility\r\n",
      "to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower\r\n",
      "and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much\r\n",
      "what he ever was.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\r\n",
      "rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\r\n",
      "something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\r\n",
      "and anxious attention, while she added:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\r\n",
      "his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from\r\n",
      "knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\r\n",
      "look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his\r\n",
      "embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\r\n",
      "accents:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\r\n",
      "comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\r\n",
      "even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\r\n",
      "may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only\r\n",
      "deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only\r\n",
      "fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\r\n",
      "alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\r\n",
      "opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always\r\n",
      "operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be\r\n",
      "imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I\r\n",
      "am certain he has very much at heart.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\r\n",
      "slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\r\n",
      "the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\r\n",
      "him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his\r\n",
      "side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\r\n",
      "Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\r\n",
      "mutual desire of never meeting again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\r\n",
      "from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\r\n",
      "between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\r\n",
      "only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\r\n",

      "woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\r\n",

      "pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\r\n",
      "never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\r\n",
      "the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\r\n",
      "to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\r\n",
      "always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\r\n",
      "they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\r\n",
      "had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\r\n",
      "made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\r\n",
      "she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\r\n",
      "violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to\r\n",
      "the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still\r\n",
      "less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\r\n",
      "much too full of lines under the words to be made public.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\r\n",
      "humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore\r\n",
      "a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\r\n",
      "back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\r\n",
      "was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of\r\n",
      "June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\r\n",
      "tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by\r\n",
      "the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\r\n",
      "mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious\r\n",
      "arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in\r\n",
      "Meryton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\r\n",
      "approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\r\n",
      "arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\r\n",
      "curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\r\n",
      "setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\r\n",
      "within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so\r\n",
      "far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\r\n",
      "the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\r\n",
      "the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\r\n",
      "present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\r\n",
      "county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\r\n",
      "weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\r\n",
      "town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\r\n",
      "they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\r\n",
      "her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\r\n",
      "Dovedale, or the Peak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\r\n",
      "the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\r\n",
      "was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\r\n",
      "and all was soon right again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was\r\n",
      "impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\r\n",
      "owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\r\n",
      "and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\r\n",
      "before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\r\n",
      "Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\r\n",
      "younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their\r\n",
      "cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\r\n",
      "sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\r\n",
      "way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\r\n",
      "next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\r\n",
      "One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;\r\n",
      "a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\r\n",
      "inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\r\n",
      "and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\r\n",
      "disappointments abroad.\r\n",

      "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\r\n",
      "nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\r\n",
      "lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are\r\n",
      "sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\r\n",
      "concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's\r\n",
      "former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance\r\n",
      "still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\r\n",
      "principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not\r\n",
      "in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\r\n",
      "talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed\r\n",
      "an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\r\n",
      "willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard\r\n",
      "so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your\r\n",
      "acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\r\n",
      "Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\r\n",
      "must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\r\n",
      "many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\r\n",
      "richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but\r\n",
      "the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\r\n",
      "country.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\r\n",
      "possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\r\n",
      "occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and\r\n",
      "thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\r\n",
      "a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\r\n",
      "that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the\r\n",
      "absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\r\n",
      "whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its\r\n",
      "proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\r\n",
      "the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\r\n",
      "alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\r\n",
      "curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\r\n",
      "next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\r\n",
      "with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\r\n",
      "to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\r\n",

      "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\r\n",
      "Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\r\n",
      "in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\r\n",
      "entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\r\n",
      "a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\r\n",
      "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\r\n",
      "half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\r\n",
      "eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\r\n",
      "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\r\n",
      "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\r\n",
      "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of\r\n",
      "high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\r\n",
      "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\r\n",
      "were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\r\n",
      "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\r\n",
      "beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\r\n",
      "all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\r\n",
      "to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\r\n",
      "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\r\n",
      "meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\r\n",
      "mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\r\n",
      "hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\r\n",
      "wonder at her being where she was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less\r\n",
      "fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\r\n",
      "followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned\r\n",
      "room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\r\n",
      "to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\r\n",
      "they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\r\n",
      "was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and\r\n",
      "she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\r\n",
      "banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\r\n",
      "with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\r\n",
      "different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\r\n",
      "seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\r\n",
      "the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\r\n",
      "his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\r\n",
      "splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\r\n",
      "these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\r\n",
      "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\r\n",
      "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting\r\n",
      "herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\r\n",
      "me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\r\n",
      "regret.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\r\n",
      "absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\r\n",
      "was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with\r\n",
      "a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\r\n",
      "journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\r\n",
      "likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\r\n",
      "over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\r\n",
      "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\r\n",
      "gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought\r\n",
      "up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;\r\n",
      "“but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\r\n",
      "return it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\r\n",
      "“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\r\n",
      "other--about eight years ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have heard much of your master's fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\r\n",
      "looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\r\n",
      "us whether it is like or not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\r\n",
      "intimation of her knowing her master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, very handsome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\r\n",
      "will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\r\n",
      "master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\r\n",
      "be then. He was very fond of them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\r\n",
      "when she was only eight years old.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\r\n",
      "accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\r\n",
      "a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\r\n",
      "comes here to-morrow with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\r\n",
      "communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\r\n",
      "by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\r\n",
      "master and his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\r\n",
      "time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\r\n",
      "good enough for him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\r\n",
      "very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”\r\n",
      " replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\r\n",
      "listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have\r\n",
      "never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever\r\n",
      "since he was four years old.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\r\n",
      "ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\r\n",
      "Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\r\n",
      "grateful to her uncle for saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\r\n",
      "having such a master.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\r\n",
      "not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\r\n",
      "good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\r\n",
      "he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\r\n",
      "world.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\r\n",
      "as affable to the poor.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\r\n",
      "of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\r\n",
      "furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\r\n",
      "prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\r\n",
      "master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\r\n",
      "many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\r\n",
      "lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but\r\n",
      "themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\r\n",
      "him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\r\n",
      "anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away\r\n",
      "like other young men.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\r\n",
      "quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\r\n",
      "sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\r\n",
      "the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\r\n",
      "give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\r\n",
      "last at Pemberley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\r\n",
      "one of the windows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\r\n",
      "the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\r\n",
      "can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There\r\n",
      "is nothing he would not do for her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\r\n",
      "all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\r\n",
      "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\r\n",
      "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\r\n",
      "Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\r\n",
      "also more intelligible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\r\n",
      "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\r\n",
      "the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\r\n",
      "her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\r\n",
      "smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\r\n",
      "looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\r\n",
      "contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's\r\n",
      "lifetime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\r\n",
      "sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\r\n",
      "their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\r\n",
      "was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\r\n",
      "of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\r\n",
      "considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\r\n",
      "much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\r\n",
      "good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\r\n",
      "forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\r\n",
      "stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\r\n",
      "eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\r\n",
      "gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\r\n",
      "softened its impropriety of expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\r\n",
      "they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\r\n",
      "consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\r\n",
      "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\r\n",
      "was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\r\n",
      "suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\r\n",
      "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\r\n",
      "instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\r\n",
      "blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\r\n",
      "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\r\n",
      "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\r\n",
      "of perfect civility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\r\n",
      "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\r\n",
      "overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\r\n",
      "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\r\n",
      "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\r\n",
      "beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\r\n",
      "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\r\n",
      "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\r\n",
      "she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\r\n",
      "alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\r\n",
      "he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\r\n",
      "impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\r\n",
      "minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\r\n",
      "her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\r\n",
      "had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\r\n",
      "to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\r\n",
      "Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\r\n",
      "distraction of his thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\r\n",
      "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\r\n",
      "leave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\r\n",
      "Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\r\n",
      "followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\r\n",
      "coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\r\n",
      "world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\r\n",
      "might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\r\n",
      "thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\r\n",
      "thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\r\n",
      "sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\r\n",
      "for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\r\n",
      "from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\r\n",
      "the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\r\n",
      "altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\r\n",
      "amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\r\n",
      "Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\r\n",
      "had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\r\n",
      "a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\r\n",
      "his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\r\n",
      "for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\r\n",
      "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\r\n",
      "reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\r\n",
      "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\r\n",
      "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\r\n",
      "seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\r\n",
      "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\r\n",
      "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\r\n",
      "was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\r\n",
      "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\r\n",
      "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\r\n",
      "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\r\n",
      "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\r\n",
      "seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\r\n",
      "composure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\r\n",
      "aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\r\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\r\n",
      "the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\r\n",
      "valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\r\n",
      "many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\r\n",
      "of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\r\n",
      "With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\r\n",
      "It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\r\n",
      "brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\r\n",
      "to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\r\n",
      "it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\r\n",
      "it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\r\n",
      "valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\r\n",
      "and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\r\n",
      "bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\r\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\r\n",
      "of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\r\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\r\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\r\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\r\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\r\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\r\n",
      "man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\r\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment\r\n",
      "was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\r\n",
      "less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\r\n",
      "they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\r\n",
      "for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\r\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\r\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\r\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\r\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\r\n",
      "that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\r\n",
      "politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\r\n",
      "but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\r\n",
      "some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\r\n",
      "Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\r\n",
      "and she said no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\r\n",
      "her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\r\n",
      "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\r\n",
      "and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\r\n",
      "acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\r\n",
      "revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\r\n",
      "she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of\r\n",
      "fashion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\r\n",
      "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\r\n",
      "it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\r\n",
      "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\r\n",
      "connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\r\n",
      "so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\r\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\r\n",
      "could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\r\n",
      "some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\r\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\r\n",
      "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\r\n",
      "his taste, or his good manners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\r\n",
      "chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\r\n",
      "to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\r\n",
      "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\r\n",
      "walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\r\n",
      "must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\r\n",
      "continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can\r\n",
      "it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\r\n",
      "manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\r\n",
      "change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\r\n",
      "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\r\n",
      "the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\r\n",
      "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\r\n",
      "in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\r\n",
      "her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\r\n",
      "together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\r\n",
      "to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\r\n",
      "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\r\n",
      "very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\r\n",
      "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\r\n",
      "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\r\n",
      "in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\r\n",
      "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\r\n",
      "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\r\n",
      "will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\r\n",
      "who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\r\n",
      "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last\r\n",
      "mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\r\n",
      "mind was not very differently engaged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\r\n",
      "pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\r\n",
      "me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\r\n",
      "during your stay at Lambton?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\r\n",
      "for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\r\n",
      "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\r\n",
      "must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\r\n",
      "satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\r\n",
      "him think really ill of her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\r\n",
      "was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\r\n",
      "pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\r\n",
      "the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\r\n",
      "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\r\n",
      "mile behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\r\n",
      "tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\r\n",
      "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\r\n",
      "there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\r\n",
      "that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\r\n",
      "with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\r\n",
      "patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was\r\n",
      "over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go\r\n",
      "into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\r\n",
      "they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\r\n",
      "ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\r\n",
      "walking slowly towards the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\r\n",
      "pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\r\n",
      "“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\r\n",
      "aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\r\n",
      "say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\r\n",
      "have seen nothing of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\r\n",
      "than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\r\n",
      "attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\r\n",
      "or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features\r\n",
      "are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so\r\n",
      "disagreeable?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\r\n",
      "him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\r\n",
      "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\r\n",
      "her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\r\n",
      "at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off\r\n",
      "his grounds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\r\n",
      "said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\r\n",
      "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\r\n",
      "anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\r\n",
      "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\r\n",
      "speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would\r\n",
      "not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\r\n",
      "good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\r\n",
      "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\r\n",
      "master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every\r\n",
      "virtue.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\r\n",
      "his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\r\n",
      "as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\r\n",
      "his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\r\n",
      "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\r\n",
      "Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\r\n",
      "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\r\n",
      "transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\r\n",
      "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\r\n",
      "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\r\n",
      "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\r\n",
      "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\r\n",
      "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they\r\n",
      "had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\r\n",
      "acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\r\n",
      "intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\r\n",
      "much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\r\n",
      "but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above\r\n",
      "all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\r\n",

      "Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\r\n",
      "her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\r\n",
      "resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\r\n",
      "But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\r\n",
      "arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\r\n",
      "place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\r\n",
      "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\r\n",
      "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\r\n",
      "a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\r\n",
      "the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\r\n",
      "surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\r\n",
      "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\r\n",
      "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\r\n",
      "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\r\n",
      "the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\r\n",
      "there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\r\n",
      "quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\r\n",
      "newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\r\n",
      "amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\r\n",
      "she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\r\n",
      "in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\r\n",
      "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\r\n",
      "up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\r\n",
      "inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\r\n",
      "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\r\n",
      "acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\r\n",
      "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\r\n",
      "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\r\n",
      "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\r\n",
      "her beyond a monosyllable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\r\n",
      "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\r\n",
      "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\r\n",
      "was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\r\n",
      "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\r\n",
      "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\r\n",
      "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\r\n",
      "was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\r\n",
      "satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\r\n",
      "step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\r\n",
      "felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\r\n",
      "cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\r\n",
      "inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\r\n",
      "and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\r\n",
      "than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\r\n",
      "them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\r\n",
      "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\r\n",
      "each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\r\n",
      "those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\r\n",
      "what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\r\n",
      "in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\r\n",
      "evident enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\r\n",
      "feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\r\n",
      "to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\r\n",
      "feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\r\n",
      "endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\r\n",
      "was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\r\n",
      "how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\r\n",
      "a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\r\n",
      "former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\r\n",
      "that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\r\n",
      "though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\r\n",
      "behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\r\n",
      "appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\r\n",
      "between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\r\n",
      "she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\r\n",
      "ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\r\n",
      "recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\r\n",
      "more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\r\n",
      "to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\r\n",
      "which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since\r\n",
      "he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,\r\n",
      "he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\r\n",
      "November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\r\n",
      "took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\r\n",
      "_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\r\n",
      "nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\r\n",
      "gave them meaning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\r\n",
      "but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\r\n",
      "complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\r\n",
      "from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\r\n",
      "the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\r\n",
      "temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\r\n",
      "she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\r\n",
      "of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\r\n",
      "disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\r\n",
      "very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\r\n",
      "lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\r\n",
      "so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\r\n",
      "restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\r\n",
      "of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\r\n",
      "at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\r\n",
      "self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\r\n",
      "could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\r\n",
      "acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\r\n",
      "down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\r\n",
      "Rosings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\r\n",
      "to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\r\n",
      "their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\r\n",
      "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\r\n",
      "diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\r\n",
      "readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\r\n",
      "how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\r\n",
      "acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\r\n",
      "that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\r\n",
      "any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\r\n",
      "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\r\n",
      "her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\r\n",
      "again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\r\n",
      "make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\r\n",
      "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\r\n",
      "this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\r\n",
      "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\r\n",
      "satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\r\n",
      "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\r\n",
      "uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\r\n",
      "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\r\n",
      "not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\r\n",
      "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\r\n",
      "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\r\n",
      "interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\r\n",
      "as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\r\n",
      "not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\r\n",
      "from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\r\n",
      "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\r\n",
      "would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\r\n",
      "however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\r\n",
      "that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\r\n",
      "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\r\n",
      "hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\r\n",
      "their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\r\n",
      "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\r\n",
      "it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\r\n",
      "where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\r\n",
      "was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\r\n",
      "there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\r\n",
      "son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\r\n",
      "fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\r\n",
      "him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\r\n",
      "the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\r\n",
      "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\r\n",
      "and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\r\n",
      "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\r\n",
      "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\r\n",
      "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\r\n",
      "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\r\n",
      "time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\r\n",
      "into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\r\n",
      "his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\r\n",
      "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\r\n",
      "there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\r\n",
      "It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\r\n",
      "but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\r\n",
      "acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\r\n",
      "accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\r\n",
      "her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\r\n",
      "eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\r\n",
      "of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\r\n",
      "were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\r\n",
      "on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\r\n",
      "pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\r\n",
      "love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\r\n",
      "sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\r\n",
      "exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\r\n",
      "she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\r\n",
      "far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\r\n",
      "be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\r\n",
      "fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\r\n",
      "his addresses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\r\n",
      "such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the\r\n",
      "very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\r\n",
      "late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\r\n",
      "by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\r\n",
      "it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\r\n",
      "morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\r\n",
      "she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\r\n",
      "renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\r\n",
      "some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had\r\n",
      "originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her\r\n",
      "appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how\r\n",
      "much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\r\n",
      "whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\r\n",
      "opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\r\n",
      "hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\r\n",
      "which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\r\n",
      "with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\r\n",
      "London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with\r\n",
      "all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\r\n",
      "of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\r\n",
      "the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\r\n",
      "however, did her justice, and pitied her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\r\n",
      "on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\r\n",
      "succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\r\n",
      "genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\r\n",
      "of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\r\n",
      "others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\r\n",
      "wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\r\n",
      "short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\r\n",
      "and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\r\n",
      "calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\r\n",
      "from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\r\n",
      "inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\r\n",
      "of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\r\n",
      "moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\r\n",
      "feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\r\n",
      "she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\r\n",
      "sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\r\n",
      "inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\r\n",
      "indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\r\n",
      "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\r\n",
      "finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\r\n",
      "a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\r\n",
      "given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\r\n",
      "party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\r\n",
      "beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\r\n",
      "them round the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\r\n",
      "she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\r\n",
      "feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\r\n",
      "a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\r\n",
      "regret that he came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\r\n",
      "gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\r\n",
      "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\r\n",
      "Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\r\n",
      "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\r\n",
      "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\r\n",
      "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\r\n",
      "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\r\n",
      "when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\r\n",
      "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\r\n",
      "smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\r\n",
      "objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\r\n",
      "to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\r\n",
      "entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\r\n",
      "was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\r\n",
      "as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\r\n",
      "first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\r\n",
      "They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\r\n",
      "instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\r\n",
      "various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\r\n",
      "but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\r\n",
      "presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\r\n",
      "she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\r\n",
      "complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\r\n",
      "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\r\n",
      "pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\r\n",
      "have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\r\n",
      "Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\r\n",
      "her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\r\n",
      "Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\r\n",
      "and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\r\n",
      "with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's\r\n",
      "meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\r\n",
      "was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\r\n",
      "her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\r\n",
      "wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\r\n",
      "hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\r\n",
      "meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\r\n",
      "for the welfare of his friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\r\n",
      "as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\r\n",
      "Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\r\n",
      "to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\r\n",
      "recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\r\n",
      "had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\r\n",
      "fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\r\n",
      "mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,\r\n",
      "behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's\r\n",
      "recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\r\n",
      "err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\r\n",
      "without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\r\n",
      "Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\r\n",
      "him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she\r\n",
      "cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since\r\n",
      "the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing\r\n",
      "that we should not have known her again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\r\n",
      "himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\r\n",
      "her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\r\n",
      "summer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could\r\n",
      "see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\r\n",
      "brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\r\n",
      "wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\r\n",

      "head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\r\n",
      "Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\r\n",

      "but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\r\n",
      "coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that\r\n",
      "is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\r\n",
      "I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that\r\n",

      "them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but\r\n",
      "without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With\r\n",
      "the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\r\n",
      "to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved\r\n",
      "for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our\r\n",
      "distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the\r\n",
      "worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make\r\n",
      "it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue\r\n",
      "their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a\r\n",
      "young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\r\n",
      "her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that\r\n",

      "exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And\r\n",
      "as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has\r\n",
      "anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of\r\n",
      "confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\r\n",
      "have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the\r\n",
      "first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not\r\n",
      "so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I\r\n",
      "take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but\r\n",
      "circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to\r\n",
      "come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,\r\n",
      "that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something\r\n",
      "more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\r\n",

      "measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to\r\n",
      "be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\r\n",
      "uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\r\n",
      "immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\r\n",

      "a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\r\n",
      "opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\r\n",
      "manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,\r\n",
      "she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,\r\n",
      "hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\r\n",

      "an instant to lose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\r\n",
      "but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\r\n",
      "not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\r\n",
      "little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\r\n",
      "the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\r\n",
      "an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\r\n",
      "mistress home instantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\r\n",
      "looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\r\n",
      "or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\r\n",
      "“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\r\n",
      "present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\r\n",
      "is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by\r\n",
      "some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\r\n",
      "not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\r\n",
      "something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\r\n",
      "silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,\r\n",
      "with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\r\n",
      "sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\r\n",
      "the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\r\n",
      "_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\r\n",
      "connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet\r\n",
      "more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what\r\n",
      "he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I\r\n",
      "learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\r\n",
      "have happened. But it is all--all too late now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it\r\n",
      "certain--absolutely certain?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\r\n",
      "almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\r\n",
      "Scotland.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\r\n",
      "immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But\r\n",
      "nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\r\n",
      "such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\r\n",
      "not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\r\n",

      "“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what\r\n",

      "much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air\r\n",
      "gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her\r\n",
      "power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\r\n",
      "weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\r\n",
      "wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\r\n",
      "consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\r\n",
      "was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\r\n",
      "wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\r\n",
      "him, as now, when all love must be vain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\r\n",
      "humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\r\n",
      "up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\r\n",
      "several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\r\n",
      "the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\r\n",
      "compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been\r\n",
      "long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\r\n",
      "stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\r\n",
      "could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\r\n",
      "such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\r\n",
      "seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\r\n",
      "fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\r\n",
      "to-day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\r\n",
      "urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\r\n",
      "long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\r\n",
      "her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\r\n",
      "reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\r\n",
      "one serious, parting look, went away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\r\n",
      "should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\r\n",
      "had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\r\n",
      "retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\r\n",
      "of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\r\n",
      "feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\r\n",
      "formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\r\n",
      "change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\r\n",
      "otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\r\n",
      "unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\r\n",
      "a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\r\n",
      "exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\r\n",
      "somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\r\n",
      "and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\r\n",
      "less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\r\n",
      "go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\r\n",
      "produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\r\n",
      "business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\r\n",
      "a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\r\n",
      "could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\r\n",
      "of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\r\n",
      "letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\r\n",
      "Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\r\n",
      "for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\r\n",
      "incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\r\n",
      "as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\r\n",
      "Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\r\n",
      "of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\r\n",
      "nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\r\n",
      "Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\r\n",
      "wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\r\n",
      "officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\r\n",
      "raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\r\n",
      "fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\r\n",
      "mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\r\n",
      "feel it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\r\n",
      "share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\r\n",
      "family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\r\n",
      "requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\r\n",
      "could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\r\n",
      "importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's\r\n",
      "account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\r\n",
      "instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\r\n",
      "summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\r\n",
      "of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a\r\n",
      "favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\r\n",
      "afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\r\n",
      "first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\r\n",
      "assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\r\n",
      "him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\r\n",
      "everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\r\n",
      "be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”\r\n",
      " cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\r\n",
      "us; was it so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\r\n",
      "_That_ is all settled.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\r\n",
      "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\r\n",
      "to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\r\n",
      "impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\r\n",
      "business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\r\n",
      "be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\r\n",
      "sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\r\n",
      "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\r\n",
      "the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\r\n",
      "have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\r\n",

      "“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\r\n",
      "drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\r\n",
      "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the\r\n",
      "matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should\r\n",
      "form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\r\n",
      "friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\r\n",
      "am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\r\n",
      "would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\r\n",
      "regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\r\n",
      "not adequate to the risk!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle's\r\n",
      "opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\r\n",
      "interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of\r\n",
      "Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\r\n",
      "him capable of it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\r\n",
      "neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\r\n",
      "dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\r\n",
      "the case?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\r\n",
      "that they are not gone to Scotland.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\r\n",
      "a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\r\n",
      "Barnet road.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\r\n",
      "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\r\n",
      "not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\r\n",
      "might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\r\n",
      "expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\r\n",
      "marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\r\n",
      "friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\r\n",
      "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\r\n",
      "cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\r\n",
      "beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\r\n",
      "forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\r\n",
      "restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\r\n",
      "dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\r\n",
      "nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\r\n",
      "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\r\n",
      "no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\r\n",
      "behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\r\n",
      "seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\r\n",
      "do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\r\n",
      "such a matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\r\n",
      "as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\r\n",
      "tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such\r\n",
      "a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\r\n",
      "Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\r\n",
      "been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,\r\n",
      "nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement\r\n",
      "and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\r\n",
      "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\r\n",
      "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\r\n",
      "flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing\r\n",
      "everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\r\n",
      "greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\r\n",
      "naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\r\n",
      "person and address that can captivate a woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of\r\n",
      "Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\r\n",
      "their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\r\n",
      "till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\r\n",
      "Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\r\n",
      "sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\r\n",
      "as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\r\n",
      "as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,\r\n",
      "of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at\r\n",
      "Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved\r\n",
      "with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\r\n",
      "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\r\n",
      "relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\r\n",
      "what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\r\n",
      "reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\r\n",
      "must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\r\n",
      "her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\r\n",
      "and Jane seem so well to understand?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\r\n",
      "so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\r\n",
      "ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\r\n",
      "was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the\r\n",
      "case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\r\n",
      "necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\r\n",
      "it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\r\n",
      "neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\r\n",
      "settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\r\n",
      "her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\r\n",
      "in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\r\n",
      "consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\r\n",
      "enough from my thoughts.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\r\n",
      "suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\r\n",
      "side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\r\n",
      "that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\r\n",
      "he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\r\n",
      "were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\r\n",
      "the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\r\n",
      "attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\r\n",
      "wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\r\n",
      "who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "                          * * * * *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\r\n",
      "to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\r\n",
      "its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\r\n",
      "the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.\r\n",
      "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find\r\n",
      "no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\r\n",
      "on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a\r\n",
      "comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\r\n",
      "by long expectations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\r\n",
      "on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the\r\n",
      "carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\r\n",
      "faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\r\n",
      "capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\r\n",
      "hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her\r\n",
      "mother's apartment, immediately met her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\r\n",
      "eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\r\n",
      "heard of the fugitives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\r\n",
      "everything will be well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is my father in town?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And have you heard from him often?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say\r\n",
      "that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\r\n",
      "particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write\r\n",
      "again till he had something of importance to mention.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\r\n",
      "shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\r\n",
      "all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\r\n",
      "Heaven, are quite well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\r\n",
      "must have gone through!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\r\n",
      "conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\r\n",
      "engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach\r\n",
      "of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\r\n",
      "thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\r\n",
      "had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\r\n",
      "found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of\r\n",
      "good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet\r\n",
      "deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\r\n",
      "every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\r\n",
      "to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'\r\n",
      "conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\r\n",
      "tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\r\n",
      "conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\r\n",
      "blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\r\n",
      "errors of her daughter must principally be owing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,\r\n",
      "with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia\r\n",
      "had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\r\n",
      "of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\r\n",
      "side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\r\n",
      "well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the\r\n",
      "charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!\r\n",
      "And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,\r\n",
      "wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become\r\n",
      "of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his\r\n",
      "grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we\r\n",
      "shall do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\r\n",
      "general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\r\n",
      "that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\r\n",
      "Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be\r\n",
      "prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\r\n",
      "It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we\r\n",
      "may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\r\n",
      "and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\r\n",
      "lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make\r\n",
      "him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult\r\n",
      "together as to what is to be done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\r\n",
      "could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\r\n",
      "wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\r\n",
      "marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\r\n",
      "tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\r\n",
      "after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\r\n",
      "Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my\r\n",
      "wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such\r\n",
      "spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\r\n",
      "I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to\r\n",
      "give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does\r\n",
      "not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I\r\n",
      "know you will contrive it all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\r\n",
      "in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well\r\n",
      "in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till\r\n",
      "dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on\r\n",
      "the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\r\n",
      "occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\r\n",
      "oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\r\n",
      "tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\r\n",
      "better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\r\n",
      "most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\r\n",
      "subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\r\n",
      "too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\r\n",
      "before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\r\n",
      "faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\r\n",
      "in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\r\n",
      "which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of\r\n",
      "fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\r\n",
      "mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\r\n",
      "of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\r\n",
      "But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\r\n",
      "each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\r\n",
      "“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\r\n",
      "lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one\r\n",
      "false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less\r\n",
      "brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in\r\n",
      "her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed\r\n",
      "to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\r\n",
      "kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\r\n",
      "half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of\r\n",
      "the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\r\n",
      "satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\r\n",
      "of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\r\n",
      "the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which\r\n",
      "I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\r\n",
      "Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\r\n",
      "took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\r\n",
      "especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\r\n",
      "grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\r\n",
      "_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\r\n",
      "any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\r\n",
      "first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\r\n",
      "their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\r\n",
      "their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\r\n",
      "repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\r\n",
      "inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\r\n",
      "doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt\r\n",
      "a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him\r\n",
      "in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\r\n",
      "right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\r\n",
      "imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\r\n",
      "triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter\r\n",
      "she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\r\n",
      "being in love with each other, many weeks.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But not before they went to Brighton?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I believe not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does\r\n",
      "he know his real character?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\r\n",
      "did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\r\n",
      "affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;\r\n",

      "in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\r\n",
      "suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from\r\n",

      "your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because\r\n",

      "may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the\r\n",
      "most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would\r\n",
      "have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\r\n",
      "be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\r\n",
      "informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\r\n",
      "proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,\r\n",
      "for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\r\n",

      "in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to\r\n",
      "console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\r\n",

      "thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\r\n",

      "uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\r\n",
      "thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\r\n",
      "of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\r\n",

      "exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\r\n",
      "not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never\r\n",
      "be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\r\n",
      "protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\r\n",
      "years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\r\n",
      "actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\r\n",
      "she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\r\n",

      "marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\r\n",
      "thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\r\n",
      "they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\r\n",

      "together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\r\n",
      "would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\r\n",
      "the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\r\n",
      "soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon\r\n",
      "married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\r\n",
      "exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she\r\n",
      "had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\r\n",
      "would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\r\n",

      "of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\r\n",
      "naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\r\n",
      "dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick\r\n",
      "in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he\r\n",

      "that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\r\n",
      "daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\r\n",
      "affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\r\n",
      "it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\r\n",
      "resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\r\n",
      "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\r\n",
      "possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\r\n",

      "frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear\r\n",
      "of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,\r\n",
      "there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\r\n",

      "blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\r\n",
      "hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\r\n",

      "enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\r\n",
      "was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,\r\n",
      "and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\r\n",
      "congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\r\n",
      "round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\r\n",
      "observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\r\n",
      "there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\r\n",
      "were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\r\n",
      "exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\r\n",
      "claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had\r\n",
      "not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\r\n",
      "resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence\r\n",
      "of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the\r\n",
      "two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\r\n",
      "of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\r\n",
      "with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her\r\n",
      "replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\r\n",
      "world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\r\n",
      "voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\r\n",
      "the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;\r\n",
      "it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\r\n",
      "enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\r\n",

      "people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;\r\n",
      "and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he\r\n",
      "should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took\r\n",
      "off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that\r\n",
      "he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\r\n",
      "and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\r\n",
      "the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\r\n",
      "anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say\r\n",

      "from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\r\n",

      "all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”\r\n",
      " by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her\r\n",

      "that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\r\n",
      "o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\r\n",
      "were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\r\n",
      "such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to\r\n",
      "put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was\r\n",
      "my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\r\n",
      "if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\r\n",
      "ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\r\n",
      "to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\r\n",
      "be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\r\n",
      "were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\r\n",
      "me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\r\n",
      "fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was\r\n",
      "rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\r\n",
      "just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\r\n",
      "business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\r\n",
      "they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\r\n",
      "did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\r\n",
      "were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\r\n",
      "came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,\r\n",
      "I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the\r\n",
      "wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”\r\n",

      "“Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious\r\n",
      "me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\r\n",
      "them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\r\n",
      "subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\r\n",
      "all, and then Wickham would be angry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\r\n",
      "power, by running away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\r\n",
      "it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at\r\n",
      "her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\r\n",
      "where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\r\n",
      "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\r\n",
      "brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\r\n",
      "placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\r\n",
      "could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\r\n",
      "wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\r\n",
      "Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\r\n",
      "intended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be\r\n",
      "to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\r\n",

      "hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\r\n",

      "Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\r\n",
      "after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\r\n",
      "them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\r\n",
      "himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to\r\n",
      "make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\r\n",
      "in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\r\n",
      "confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\r\n",
      "actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\r\n",
      "called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\r\n",
      "an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\r\n",
      "motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\r\n",
      "in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\r\n",

      "house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\r\n",

      "wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\r\n",

      "of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\r\n",
      "other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\r\n",
      "it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\r\n",
      "in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\r\n",
      "been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\r\n",
      "on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\r\n",
      "scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her\r\n",
      "own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\r\n",
      "to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\r\n",
      "must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\r\n",

      "marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\r\n",
      "cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to\r\n",
      "make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\r\n",
      "street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\r\n",
      "seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\r\n",
      "still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\r\n",
      "your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\r\n",
      "uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\r\n",
      "departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\r\n",

      "obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\r\n",
      "accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\r\n",
      "the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\r\n",
      "was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\r\n",
      "niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\r\n",
      "which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\r\n",
      "this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\r\n",
      "that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\r\n",
      "it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\r\n",
      "at most.\r\n",

      "more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\r\n",
      "settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\r\n",
      "this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\r\n",
      "was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\r\n",
      "Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\r\n",
      "had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\r\n",
      "in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,\r\n",
      "can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\r\n",
      "my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\r\n",

      "serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\r\n",
      "done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\r\n",

      "Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he\r\n",
      "never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\r\n",
      "by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\r\n",
      "had said enough to keep him quiet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was\r\n",
      "forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\r\n",
      "entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\r\n",
      "continue at least a twelvemonth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Write to me very often, my dear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\r\n",
      "writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\r\n",
      "do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He\r\n",
      "smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\r\n",
      "the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to\r\n",
      "us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\r\n",
      "himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\r\n",
      "one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\r\n",
      "Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\r\n",
      "single.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,\r\n",
      "but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If\r\n",
      "that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\r\n",
      "relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\r\n",
      "article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\r\n",
      "at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\r\n",
      "master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\r\n",
      "weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\r\n",
      "smiled and shook her head by turns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\r\n",
      "Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not\r\n",
      "that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am\r\n",
      "sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome\r\n",
      "to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?\r\n",
      "But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to\r\n",
      "mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in\r\n",
      "Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\r\n",
      "to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He\r\n",
      "comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\r\n",
      "going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\r\n",
      "Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\r\n",
      "colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\r\n",
      "Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\r\n",
      "report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from\r\n",
      "any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\r\n",
      "I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\r\n",
      "me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\r\n",
      "alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\r\n",
      "_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\r\n",
      "Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\r\n",
      "other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\r\n",
      "to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\r\n",
      "there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\r\n",
      "without it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot\r\n",
      "come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this\r\n",
      "speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\r\n",
      "feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\r\n",
      "perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\r\n",
      "more unequal, than she had often seen them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\r\n",
      "about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\r\n",
      "will wait on him of course.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\r\n",
      "went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\r\n",
      "nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\r\n",
      "would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\r\n",
      "Netherfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“'Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,\r\n",
      "let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours\r\n",
      "in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\r\n",
      "again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\r\n",
      "on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I\r\n",
      "am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\r\n",
      "make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\r\n",
      "him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\r\n",
      "husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\r\n",
      "neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\r\n",
      "_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\r\n",
      "would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\r\n",
      "hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\r\n",
      "but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\r\n",
      "says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\r\n",
      "is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\r\n",
      "of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\r\n",
      "always so much.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\r\n",
      "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\r\n",
      "and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted\r\n",
      "the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\r\n",
      "hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\r\n",
      "arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\r\n",
      "enter the paddock and ride towards the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\r\n",
      "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\r\n",
      "to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\r\n",
      "again by her sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\r\n",
      "him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\r\n",
      "say that I hate the very sight of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\r\n",
      "of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\r\n",
      "which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\r\n",
      "after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\r\n",
      "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\r\n",
      "mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\r\n",
      "civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either\r\n",
      "of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\r\n",
      "suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\r\n",
      "Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\r\n",
      "To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\r\n",
      "and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\r\n",
      "information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\r\n",
      "for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\r\n",
      "interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\r\n",
      "what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\r\n",
      "coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\r\n",
      "was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\r\n",
      "behaviour in Derbyshire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\r\n",
      "minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\r\n",
      "her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\r\n",
      "wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\r\n",
      "enough for expectation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\r\n",
      "lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of\r\n",
      "her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\r\n",
      "paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\r\n",
      "gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\r\n",
      "tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\r\n",
      "symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\r\n",
      "again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\r\n",
      "had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,\r\n",
      "she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\r\n",
      "she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\r\n",
      "presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\r\n",
      "not an improbable, conjecture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\r\n",
      "saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\r\n",
      "especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\r\n",
      "her curtsey and address to his friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\r\n",
      "the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\r\n",
      "was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\r\n",
      "applied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\r\n",
      "which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He\r\n",
      "was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\r\n",
      "it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\r\n",
      "when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\r\n",
      "bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\r\n",
      "the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\r\n",
      "found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\r\n",
      "the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\r\n",
      "they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\r\n",
      "with herself for being so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\r\n",
      "him she had hardly courage to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He readily agreed to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say\r\n",
      "you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\r\n",
      "it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\r\n",
      "since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\r\n",
      "own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\r\n",
      "seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\r\n",
      "though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\r\n",
      "George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\r\n",
      "syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\r\n",
      "It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\r\n",
      "make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\r\n",
      "dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\r\n",
      "not tell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\r\n",
      " continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\r\n",
      "hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\r\n",
      "Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay\r\n",
      "I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have\r\n",
      "heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\r\n",
      "regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\r\n",
      "many as he deserves.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\r\n",
      "misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\r\n",
      "however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\r\n",
      "done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in\r\n",
      "the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\r\n",
      "“I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\r\n",
      "Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\r\n",
      "will save all the best of the covies for you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\r\n",
      "attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\r\n",
      "flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\r\n",
      "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt\r\n",
      "that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\r\n",
      "moments of such painful confusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to\r\n",
      "be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\r\n",
      "that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\r\n",
      "one or the other again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\r\n",
      "compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\r\n",
      "how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\r\n",
      "former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\r\n",
      "but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\r\n",
      "found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\r\n",
      "as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\r\n",
      "difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\r\n",
      "that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\r\n",
      "that she did not always know when she was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\r\n",
      "intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\r\n",
      "Longbourn in a few days time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when\r\n",
      "you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\r\n",
      "us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\r\n",
      "you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\r\n",
      "your engagement.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\r\n",
      "his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\r\n",
      "there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\r\n",
      "not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\r\n",
      "on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\r\n",
      "of one who had ten thousand a year.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\r\n",
      "or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that\r\n",
      "must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\r\n",
      "“did he come at all?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when\r\n",
      "he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If\r\n",
      "he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will\r\n",
      "think no more about him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\r\n",
      "of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her\r\n",
      "better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\r\n",
      "easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\r\n",
      "his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\r\n",
      "seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent\r\n",
      "acquaintance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\r\n",
      "the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\r\n",
      "humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had\r\n",
      "revived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\r\n",
      "who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality\r\n",
      "as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\r\n",
      "dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\r\n",
      "the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\r\n",
      "her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore\r\n",
      "to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\r\n",
      "hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\r\n",
      "decided. He placed himself by her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\r\n",
      "He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\r\n",
      "Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\r\n",
      "likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\r\n",
      "alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an\r\n",
      "admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\r\n",
      "own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\r\n",
      "consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\r\n",
      "gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\r\n",
      "no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\r\n",
      "could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\r\n",
      "such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\r\n",
      "advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\r\n",
      "she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\r\n",
      "cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,\r\n",
      "made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\r\n",
      "and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\r\n",
      "him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\r\n",
      "family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\r\n",
      "bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\r\n",
      "without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than\r\n",
      "the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious\r\n",
      "and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\r\n",
      "gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her\r\n",
      "uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\r\n",
      "her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\r\n",
      "ever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\r\n",
      "answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\r\n",
      "where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\r\n",
      "in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\r\n",
      "which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\r\n",
      "the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\r\n",
      "do we?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\r\n",
      "her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\r\n",
      "to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for\r\n",
      "being so silly!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\r\n",
      "expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\r\n",
      "protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\r\n",
      "There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\r\n",
      "himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”\r\n",

      "these three weeks.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\r\n",
      "some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering\r\n",
      "to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies\r\n",
      "all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,\r\n",
      "when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her\r\n",
      "mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\r\n",
      "with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\r\n",
      "They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\r\n",
      "nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\r\n",
      "of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\r\n",
      "supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\r\n",
      "others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What\r\n",
      "say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\r\n",
      "I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\r\n",
      "venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so\r\n",
      "fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\r\n",
      "Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\r\n",
      "were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\r\n",
      "cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\r\n",
      "beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\r\n",
      "what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\r\n",
      "at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\r\n",
      "a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\r\n",
      "and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\r\n",
      "last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\r\n",
      "any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed\r\n",

      "A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\r\n",
      "friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\r\n",
      "ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\r\n",
      "good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\r\n",
      "expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\r\n",

      "“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them\r\n",
      "dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing\r\n",
      "gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\r\n",
      "come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\r\n",
      "Lizzy's hair.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\r\n",
      "forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\r\n",

      "without one of her sisters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\r\n",
      "evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\r\n",
      "custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of\r\n",
      "the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\r\n",
      "Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\r\n",
      "impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\r\n",
      "Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do\r\n",
      "you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\r\n",
      "five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\r\n",
      "suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to\r\n",
      "speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look\r\n",
      "at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her\r\n",
      "entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet half-opened the door and called out:\r\n",

      "“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\r\n",

      "Elizabeth was forced to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as\r\n",
      "soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in\r\n",
      "my dressing-room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\r\n",

      "into the drawing-room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every\r\n",
      "thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His\r\n",
      "ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their\r\n",
      "evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\r\n",
      "mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\r\n",
      "of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\r\n",
      "away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\r\n",
      "between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\r\n",
      "the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\r\n",
      "persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\r\n",
      "concurrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent\r\n",
      "the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\r\n",
      "agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\r\n",
      "or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\r\n",
      "silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\r\n",
      "other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\r\n",
      "and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\r\n",
      "every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\r\n",
      "to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\r\n",
      "for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\r\n",
      "saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\r\n",
      "had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\r\n",
      "sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\r\n",
      "earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\r\n",
      "both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would\r\n",
      "have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she\r\n",
      "thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\r\n",
      "well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\r\n",
      "words to her sister, ran out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\r\n",
      "pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\r\n",
      "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“'Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\r\n",
      "why is not everybody as happy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,\r\n",
      "a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\r\n",
      "kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\r\n",
      "allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\r\n",
      "said for the present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any\r\n",
      "account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\r\n",
      "from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\r\n",
      "know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\r\n",
      "family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\r\n",
      "with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\r\n",
      "previous months of suspense and vexation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend's anxious\r\n",

      "happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\r\n",
      "father had been short and to the purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\r\n",
      "and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed\r\n",
      "her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\r\n",
      "great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\r\n",
      "to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\r\n",
      "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\r\n",
      "expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\r\n",
      "basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\r\n",
      "Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\r\n",
      "Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\r\n",
      "made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\r\n",
      "her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or\r\n",
      "speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\r\n",
      "though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when\r\n",
      "Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\r\n",
      "how really happy he was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\r\n",
      "goodness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\r\n",
      "thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\r\n",
      "doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\r\n",
      "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\r\n",

      "“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\r\n",
      "talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\r\n",
      "more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\r\n",
      "happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\r\n",
      "would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\r\n",
      "be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\r\n",
      "he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\r\n",

      "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\r\n",
      "coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\r\n",
      "supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\r\n",
      "detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself\r\n",
      "obliged to accept.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\r\n",
      "while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;\r\n",
      "but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours\r\n",
      "of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he\r\n",
      "always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\r\n",
      "her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\r\n",
      "relief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to\r\n",
      "his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\r\n",
      "chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\r\n",
      "as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\r\n",
      "learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\r\n",
      "can never be what we once were to each other.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\r\n",
      "heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\r\n",
      "the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\r\n",
      "he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\r\n",
      "indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "modesty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\r\n",

      "to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,\r\n",
      "though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she\r\n",
      "knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\r\n",
      "formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\r\n",
      "dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\r\n",
      "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up\r\n",
      "the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\r\n",
      "equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\r\n",
      "were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\r\n",
      "preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\r\n",
      "somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\r\n",
      "the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\r\n",
      "shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\r\n",
      "continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\r\n",
      "open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\r\n",
      "astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\r\n",
      "inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\r\n",
      "other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the\r\n",
      "head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\r\n",
      "name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\r\n",
      "introduction had been made.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\r\n",
      "high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\r\n",
      "for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\r\n",
      "mother.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\r\n",
      "summer; the windows are full west.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then\r\n",
      "added:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Collins well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\r\n",
      "Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\r\n",
      "letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\r\n",
      "refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\r\n",
      "declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\r\n",
      "on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\r\n",
      "will favour me with your company.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the\r\n",
      "different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\r\n",
      "attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\r\n",
      "hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\r\n",
      "drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\r\n",
      "looking rooms, walked on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\r\n",
      "waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\r\n",
      "that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\r\n",
      "conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\r\n",
      "disagreeable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\r\n",
      "her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\r\n",
      "manner:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\r\n",
      "journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\r\n",
      "come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\r\n",
      "for the honour of seeing you here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to\r\n",
      "know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\r\n",
      "choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\r\n",
      "celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\r\n",
      "moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\r\n",
      "alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\r\n",
      "sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\r\n",
      "you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\r\n",
      "afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\r\n",
      "_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\r\n",
      "so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved\r\n",
      "on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\r\n",
      "with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\r\n",
      "so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\r\n",
      "coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\r\n",
      "is in existence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\r\n",
      "industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\r\n",
      "report is spread abroad?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never heard that it was.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\r\n",
      "ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\r\n",
      "he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\r\n",
      "reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\r\n",
      "have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\r\n",
      "may have drawn him in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\r\n",
      "language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\r\n",
      "and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\r\n",
      "ever induce me to be explicit.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\r\n",
      "presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\r\n",
      "engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\r\n",
      "make an offer to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\r\n",
      "they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\r\n",
      "_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned\r\n",
      "the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\r\n",
      "be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\r\n",
      "inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\r\n",
      "the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\r\n",
      "tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\r\n",
      "propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\r\n",
      "hours he was destined for his cousin?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\r\n",
      "no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\r\n",
      "be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\r\n",
      "marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\r\n",
      "marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\r\n",
      "by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\r\n",
      "another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,\r\n",
      "Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\r\n",
      "friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\r\n",
      "be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\r\n",
      "Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\r\n",
      "by any of us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\r\n",
      "attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\r\n",
      "to repine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\r\n",
      "for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\r\n",
      "score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\r\n",
      "here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\r\n",
      "I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's\r\n",
      "whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;\r\n",
      "but it will have no effect on me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\r\n",
      "nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\r\n",
      "side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\r\n",
      "honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on\r\n",
      "both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\r\n",
      "every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\r\n",
      "The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,\r\n",
      "or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\r\n",
      "were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in\r\n",
      "which you have been brought up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\r\n",
      "sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\r\n",
      "equal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?\r\n",

      "not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\r\n",
      "moment's deliberation:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will make no promise of the kind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\r\n",
      "reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that\r\n",
      "I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\r\n",
      "assurance I require.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\r\n",
      "anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\r\n",
      "your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their\r\n",
      "marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would\r\n",
      "my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\r\n",
      "Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\r\n",
      "supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the\r\n",
      "application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if\r\n",
      "you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your\r\n",
      "nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;\r\n",

      "therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\r\n",
      "objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am\r\n",
      "no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\r\n",

      "hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\r\n",

      "of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\r\n",
      "so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\r\n",
      "circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\r\n",

      "arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\r\n",
      "innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\r\n",

They attacked him in\\r\\n      various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\\r\\n      distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\\r\\n      last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\\r\\n      Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\\r\\n      delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\r\\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\\r\\n      with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\\r\\n      dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes\\r\\n      of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.\\r\\n    \",\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten\\r\\n      minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\\r\\n      admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\\r\\n      much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,\\r\\n      for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he\\r\\n      wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\\r\\n      housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\\r\\n      was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to\\r\\n      accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\\r\\n      disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so\\r\\n      soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he\\r\\n      might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\\r\\n      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by\\r\\n      starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party\\r\\n      for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring\\r\\n      twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls\\r\\n      grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before\\r\\n      the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him\\r\\n      from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party\\r\\n      entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young\\r\\n      man.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\r\\n      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\\r\\n      with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\\r\\n      looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of\\r\\n      the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\\r\\n      report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his\\r\\n      entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him\\r\\n      to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer\\r\\n      than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\\r\\n      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of\\r\\n      his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his\\r\\n      company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in\\r\\n      Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable\\r\\n      countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people\\r\\n      in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry\\r\\n      that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at\\r\\n      Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a\\r\\n      contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\\r\\n      Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\\r\\n      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,\\r\\n      speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.\\r\\n      He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody\\r\\n      hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent\\r\\n      against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was\\r\\n      sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\\r\\n      daughters.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\r\\n      down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\r\\n      standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to\\r\\n      join it.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing\\r\\n      about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly\\r\\n      acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be\\r\\n      insupportable.

       " '\\r\\n      “Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at\\r\\n      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\\r\\n      “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt ',\n",
       " '; I am in no\\r\\n      humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by\\r\\n      other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for\\r\\n      you are wasting your time with me.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\r\\n      remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\\r\\n      however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\r\\n      playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by\\r\\n      his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,\\r\\n      though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard\\r\\n      herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\\r\\n      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to\\r\\n      be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at\\r\\n      a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the\\r\\n      village where they lived, and of which they were the principal\\r\\n      inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless\\r\\n      of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to\\r\\n      the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He\\r\\n      had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be\\r\\n      disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.\\r\\n    \",\n",

Only think of ',\n",
       " ', my dear; he actually danced with her\\r\\n      twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\r\\n      time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\r\\n      up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\r\\n      can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down\\r\\n      the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her\\r\\n      for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two\\r\\n      fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\\r\\n      sixth with Lizzy, and the ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\r\\n      description of finery.

       " \"\\r\\n      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\\r\\n      the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\r\\n      quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\\r\\n      with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very\\r\\n      little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not\\r\\n      deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\\r\\n      making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.\\r\\n      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private\\r\\n      seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the\\r\\n      habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of\\r\\n      rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\r\\n      themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the\\r\\n      north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories\\r\\n      than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by\\r\\n      trade.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand\\r\\n      pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did\\r\\n      not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made\\r\\n      choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the\\r\\n      liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\\r\\n      easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his\\r\\n      days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though\\r\\n      he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means\\r\\n      unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\r\\n      married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his\\r\\n      house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two\\r\\n      years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at\\r\\n      Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was\\r\\n      pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what\\r\\n      the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of\\r\\n      great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\r\\n      easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\r\\n      could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\r\\n      never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley\\r\\n      had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In\\r\\n      understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,\\r\\n      but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\n      fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that\\r\\n      respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being\\r\\n      liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\r\\n      characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or\\r\\n      prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to\\r\\n      him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt\\r\\n      acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\\r\\n      conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\\r\\n      collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\\r\\n      none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\\r\\n      either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\r\\n      but she smiled too much.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired\\r\\n      her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\\r\\n      they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\r\\n      established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such\\r\\n      commendation to think of her as he chose.\\r\\n    ',\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were\\r\\n      particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in\\r\\n      Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of\\r\\n      knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction\\r\\n      had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his\\r\\n      business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting\\r\\n      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from\\r\\n      Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think\\r\\n      with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy\\r\\n      himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his\\r\\n      rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all\\r\\n      attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his\\r\\n      presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.\\r\\n    \",\n",

Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\\r\\n      allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\\r\\n      ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.

To\\r\\n      this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\\r\\n      detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in\\r\\n      her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\\r\\n      pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of\\r\\n      the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this\\r\\n      she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself\\r\\n      agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\\r\\n      with.\\r\\n    \",\n",

       " '\\r\\n      “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\\r\\n      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear\\r\\n      of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore\\r\\n      do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and,\\r\\n      excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with\\r\\n      me.—Yours, etc.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud,\\r\\n      “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she\\r\\n      should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\\r\\n      colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is\\r\\n      all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the\\r\\n      carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her\\r\\n      only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a thing,\\r\\n      in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when\\r\\n      one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\\r\\n      impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\r\\n      exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\\r\\n      Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\\r\\n      together.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may see\\r\\n      something of Captain Carter before he goes.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\r\\n      of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\r\\n      field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over\\r\\n      puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view\\r\\n      of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with\\r\\n      the warmth of exercise.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\r\\n      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That\\r\\n      she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty\\r\\n      weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\r\\n      Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for\\r\\n      it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\\r\\n      brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was\\r\\n      good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\\r\\n      nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\\r\\n      brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the\\r\\n      occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking\\r\\n      only of his breakfast.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\r\\n      Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\\r\\n      enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\r\\n      immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\r\\n      alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for\\r\\n      such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however,\\r\\n      to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could\\r\\n      attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary\\r\\n      kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\\r\\n      began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude\\r\\n      they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his\\r\\n      patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold,\\r\\n      and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to\\r\\n      return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed\\r\\n      readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\\r\\n      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies\\r\\n      often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do\\r\\n      elsewhere.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\\r\\n      unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\\r\\n      wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in\\r\\n      parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of\\r\\n      the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\\r\\n      Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\\r\\n      Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of\\r\\n      clothes.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\\r\\n      Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured\\r\\n      in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much\\r\\n      superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable\\r\\n      answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this,\\r\\n      repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it\\r\\n      was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill\\r\\n      themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference\\r\\n      towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the\\r\\n      enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard\\r\\n      with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions\\r\\n      to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much\\r\\n      an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very\\r\\n      little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy,\\r\\n      her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat,\\r\\n      he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards;\\r\\n      who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to\\r\\n      say to her.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\r\\n      began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\r\\n      pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she\\r\\n      had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and\\r\\n      added:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\r\\n      walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\r\\n      looked almost wild.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\r\\n      nonsensical to come at all! Why must ',\n",
       " ' be scampering about the\\r\\n      country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in\\r\\n      mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide\\r\\n      it not doing its office.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was all\\r\\n      lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when\\r\\n      she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my\\r\\n      notice.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “',\n",
       " ' observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I\\r\\n      am inclined to think that you would not wish to see ',\n",
       " ' sister\\r\\n      make such an exhibition.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Certainly not.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\r\\n      above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\\r\\n      it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a\\r\\n      most country-town indifference to decorum.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\\r\\n      Bingley.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that\\r\\n      this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A short\\r\\n      pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\\r\\n      sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\\r\\n      such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is\\r\\n      no chance of it.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “If they had uncles enough to fill ',\n",
       " ' Cheapside,” cried Bingley,\\r\\n      “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\r\\n      consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\r\\n      hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\r\\n      their dear friend's vulgar relations.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\\r\\n      leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She\\r\\n      was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late\\r\\n      in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it\\r\\n      seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs\\r\\n      herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo,\\r\\n      and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\n      playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she\\r\\n      would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book.\\r\\n      Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\\r\\n      reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am\\r\\n      ',\n",
       " ' a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and I\\r\\n      hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table\\r\\n      where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others—all\\r\\n      that his library afforded.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit;\\r\\n      but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I\\r\\n      ever looked into.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in\\r\\n      the room.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left so\\r\\n      small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\\r\\n      Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many\\r\\n      generations.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\\r\\n      books.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\r\\n      these.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\r\\n      that noble place. Charles, when you build ',\n",
       " ' house, I wish it may\\r\\n      be half as delightful as Pemberley.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I wish it may.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\n      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\r\\n      finer county in England than Derbyshire.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley\\r\\n      by purchase than by imitation.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little\\r\\n      attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the\\r\\n      card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\\r\\n      sister, to observe the game.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will she\\r\\n      be as tall as I am?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\\r\\n      rather taller.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so\\r\\n      much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for\\r\\n      her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\\r\\n      to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net\\r\\n      purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I\\r\\n      never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\\r\\n      informed that she was very accomplished.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has too\\r\\n      much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\r\\n      otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far\\r\\n      from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot\\r\\n      boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\\r\\n      acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your idea\\r\\n      of an accomplished woman.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\\r\\n      esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\r\\n      with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\r\\n      dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all\\r\\n      this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\r\\n      walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\r\\n      will be but half-deserved.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must yet\\r\\n      add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\\r\\n      extensive reading.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am no longer surprised at your knowing ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\r\\n      implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\r\\n      answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\r\\n      bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\r\\n      conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\r\\n      room.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\\r\\n      “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\\r\\n      other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\\r\\n      succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\r\\n      “there is a meanness in ',\n",

Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\\r\\n      immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be\\r\\n      of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent\\r\\n      physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to\\r\\n      comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones\\r\\n      should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly\\r\\n      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they\\r\\n      were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after\\r\\n      supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by\\r\\n      giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to\\r\\n      the sick lady and her sister.\\r\\n    \",\n",

In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note\\r\\n      sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\n      judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its\\r\\n      contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two\\r\\n      youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\r\\n    \",\n",

She\\r\\n      would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried\\r\\n      home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\r\\n      it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\n      Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\r\\n      attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\\r\\n      moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a\\r\\n      little longer on your kindness.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\r\\n      sure, will not hear of her removal.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\r\\n      “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains\\r\\n      with us.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not know\\r\\n      what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast\\r\\n      deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the\\r\\n      way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have\\r\\n      ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to ',\n",
       " '.\\r\\n      You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the\\r\\n      gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\n      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though\\r\\n      you have but a short lease.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I should\\r\\n      resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At\\r\\n      present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\r\\n      through I am afraid is pitiful.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\n      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\\r\\n      the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a\\r\\n      studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes, but intricate characters are the ',\n",
       " ' amusing. They have at\\r\\n      least that advantage.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for\\r\\n      such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\\r\\n      unvarying society.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\r\\n      observed in them for ever.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\\r\\n      country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      going on in the country as in town.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\r\\n      turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\r\\n      victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my\\r\\n      part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\r\\n      pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\\r\\n      when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\r\\n      advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\r\\n      gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at\\r\\n      all.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\r\\n      mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\\r\\n      such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\\r\\n      which you must acknowledge to be true.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\\r\\n      many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods\\r\\n      larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\r\\n      countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying\\r\\n      something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\\r\\n      Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since \",\n",
       " ' coming away.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\r\\n      William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel\\r\\n      and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. ',\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      “Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has\\r\\n      often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my\\r\\n      own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody\\r\\n      better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\\r\\n      partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\\r\\n      Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure\\r\\n      he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not.\\r\\n      Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her,\\r\\n      and very pretty they were.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has been\\r\\n      many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\r\\n      discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I have been used to consider poetry as the ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\r\\n      tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\r\\n      speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane,\\r\\n      with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\r\\n      unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\r\\n      civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\\r\\n      indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon\\r\\n      afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her\\r\\n      daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each\\r\\n      other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest\\r\\n      should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the\\r\\n      country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n    ',\n",

She had high animal spirits,\\r\\n      and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the\\r\\n      officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners\\r\\n      recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal,\\r\\n      therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly\\r\\n      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful\\r\\n      thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack\\r\\n      was delightful to their mother's ear:\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your\\r\\n      sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the\\r\\n      ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would be much better\\r\\n      to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\\r\\n      would be at Meryton again. And when you have given ',\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\\r\\n      that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on\\r\\n      her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\r\\n      admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because\\r\\n      he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\\r\\n      at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong\\r\\n      and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other\\r\\n      person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little\\r\\n      to care for his approbation.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\\r\\n      lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth,\\r\\n      said to her:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\r\\n      opportunity of dancing a reel?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\r\\n      surprise at her silence.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine\\r\\n      what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might\\r\\n      have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in\\r\\n      overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their\\r\\n      premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you,\\r\\n      that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you\\r\\n      dare.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Indeed I do not dare.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\r\\n      gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner\\r\\n      which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never\\r\\n      been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that\\r\\n      were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some\\r\\n      danger.\\r\\n    ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\r\\n      their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\\r\\n      next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\r\\n      desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\r\\n      and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\\r\\n      officers.

       " '\\r\\n      She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\\r\\n      being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as\\r\\n      to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\r\\n    ',\n",

Their powers\\r\\n      of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\\r\\n      with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\r\\n      acquaintance with spirit.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss\\r\\n      Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something\\r\\n      to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to\\r\\n      Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a\\r\\n      slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth\\r\\n      remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The\\r\\n      first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\n      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side\\r\\n      of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat\\r\\n      down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the\\r\\n      opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but\\r\\n      in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish\\r\\n      for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She\\r\\n      assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole\\r\\n      party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore\\r\\n      nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\n      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,\\r\\n      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now\\r\\n      and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.\\r\\n    \",\n",

She could\\r\\n      not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\r\\n      question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\r\\n      amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\r\\n      second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is\\r\\n      to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment\\r\\n      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I\\r\\n      have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent\\r\\n      library.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\r\\n      cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her\\r\\n      brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him\\r\\n      and said:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\r\\n      Netherfield?

       " '\\r\\n      “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he chooses,\\r\\n      before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing;\\r\\n      and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my\\r\\n      cards.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\\r\\n      carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\r\\n      tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\r\\n      more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of\\r\\n      the day.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\\r\\n      near so much like a ball.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked\\r\\n      about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\\r\\n      whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation\\r\\n      of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to\\r\\n      Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\r\\n      turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\\r\\n      long in one attitude.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\r\\n      succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.\\r\\n      He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\r\\n      Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\r\\n      directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\\r\\n      he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\\r\\n      the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\\r\\n      interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\r\\n      meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\\r\\n      him?\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe\\r\\n      on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing\\r\\n      about it.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\\r\\n      anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two\\r\\n      motives.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\\r\\n      as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing the\\r\\n      evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret\\r\\n      affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear\\r\\n      to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely\\r\\n      in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by\\r\\n      the fire.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so abominable.\\r\\n      How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\\r\\n      can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him.\\r\\n      Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\\r\\n     ',\n",

She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and\\r\\n      had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\r\\n      quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people\\r\\n      he knew, but \",\n",
       " ' had never seen anything but affability in her. She\\r\\n      had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not\\r\\n      the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood\\r\\n      nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his\\r\\n      relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he\\r\\n      could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in\\r\\n      his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\n      he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some\\r\\n      shelves in the closet up stairs.”\\r\\n     ',\n",

She is unfortunately of a sickly\\r\\n      constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\\r\\n      accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\\r\\n      informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\r\\n      resides with them.

Her ladyship seemed pleased with the\\r\\n      idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those\\r\\n      little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have\\r\\n      more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter\\r\\n      seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of\\r\\n      giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.

Mr. Collins readily assented,\\r\\n      and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it\\r\\n      to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\n      protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\\r\\n      exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose\\r\\n      Fordyce's Sermons.

The\\r\\n      subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally\\r\\n      great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the\\r\\n      self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential\\r\\n      feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had\\r\\n      recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford\\r\\n      was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his\\r\\n      veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of\\r\\n      himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made\\r\\n      him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and\\r\\n      humility.\\r\\n    ',\n",

This\\r\\n      was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their\\r\\n      father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility\\r\\n      and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\r\\n      part.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed\\r\\n      his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to\\r\\n      seniority; and for the first evening \",\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they\\r\\n      had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with\\r\\n      another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr.\\r\\n      Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he\\r\\n      bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all\\r\\n      wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to\\r\\n      find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting\\r\\n      something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\\r\\n      pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.\\r\\n      Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce\\r\\n      his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from\\r\\n      town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\r\\n      This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only\\r\\n      regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in\\r\\n      his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good\\r\\n      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his\\r\\n      side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same\\r\\n      time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still\\r\\n      standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses\\r\\n      drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\r\\n      On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly\\r\\n      towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal\\r\\n      spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on\\r\\n      his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his\\r\\n      eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\n      stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\\r\\n      looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\\r\\n      Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a\\r\\n      few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\r\\n      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to\\r\\n      imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\r\\n      passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr.\\r\\n      Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\\r\\n      pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\\r\\n      invitation.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\\r\\n      their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly\\r\\n      expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\\r\\n      carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she\\r\\n      had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street, who had told\\r\\n      her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because\\r\\n      the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr.\\r\\n      Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with her very best\\r\\n      politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his\\r\\n      intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not\\r\\n      help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship\\r\\n      to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was\\r\\n      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of\\r\\n      one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about\\r\\n      the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they\\r\\n      already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was\\r\\n      to have a lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. She had been\\r\\n      watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,\\r\\n      and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have\\r\\n      continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a\\r\\n      few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become\\r\\n      “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the\\r\\n      Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call\\r\\n      on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from\\r\\n      Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\\r\\n      protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\r\\n      tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\\r\\n      delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with\\r\\n      unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\\r\\n      between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\\r\\n      both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such\\r\\n      behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\\r\\n      Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\\r\\n      she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly\\r\\n      included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly\\r\\n      unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\n      connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in\\r\\n      the whole course of his life.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt,\\r\\n      and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single\\r\\n      evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed\\r\\n      him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had\\r\\n      the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\r\\n      Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\r\\n      struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\r\\n      might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\\r\\n      at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification;\\r\\n      but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was\\r\\n      its proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one\\r\\n      of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone\\r\\n      had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment,\\r\\n      and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\r\\n      with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\\r\\n      improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen\\r\\n      joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener,\\r\\n      whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who\\r\\n      was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.\\r\\n      To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to\\r\\n      do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent\\r\\n      imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared\\r\\n      very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and\\r\\n      when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither\\r\\n      been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest\\r\\n      degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire\\r\\n      were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them\\r\\n      were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in\\r\\n      person, countenance, air, and walk, as ',\n",
       " ' were superior to the\\r\\n      broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them\\r\\n      into the room.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\\r\\n      turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\\r\\n      himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\\r\\n      conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel\\r\\n      that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered\\r\\n      interesting by the skill of the speaker.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\r\\n      officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\r\\n      ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\r\\n      listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\r\\n      supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had\\r\\n      the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\\r\\n      improve myself, for in my situation in life—” Mrs. Phillips was very\\r\\n      glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received\\r\\n      at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed\\r\\n      danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined\\r\\n      talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon\\r\\n      grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and\\r\\n      exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\\r\\n      Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at\\r\\n      leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though\\r\\n      what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told—the\\r\\n      history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention\\r\\n      that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was\\r\\n      from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating\\r\\n      manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\r\\n      drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\r\\n      understand.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\\r\\n      thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\\r\\n      giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been\\r\\n      connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.”\\r\\n     ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      “As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have spent\\r\\n      four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I have no right to give ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\r\\n      astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\\r\\n      anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Upon my word, I say no more ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short interruption,\\r\\n      “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but\\r\\n      with ',\n",
       " ' I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded\\r\\n      by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing\\r\\n      manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I should take him, even on ',\n",

The two ladies were delighted to see their dear\\r\\n      friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked\\r\\n      what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest\\r\\n      of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as\\r\\n      possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.\\r\\n      They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which\\r\\n      took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape\\r\\n      from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\r\\n      female of the family.

Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society\\r\\n      of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth\\r\\n      thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of\\r\\n      seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behaviour. The\\r\\n      happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\n      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth,\\r\\n      meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the\\r\\n      only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.\\r\\n      And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for\\r\\n      it.\\r\\n    \",\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not\\r\\n      often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him\\r\\n      whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did,\\r\\n      whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and\\r\\n      she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever\\r\\n      on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the\\r\\n      Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\\r\\n      this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\\r\\n      have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself,\\r\\n      that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in\\r\\n      the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting\\r\\n      yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference\\r\\n      which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to\\r\\n      any disrespect for her.”\\r\\n     ',\n",

There was no help for\\r\\n      it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a\\r\\n      little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as\\r\\n      she could.

The idea soon reached to\\r\\n      conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and\\r\\n      heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and\\r\\n      though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her\\r\\n      charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the\\r\\n      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to ',\n",

Even Elizabeth might have\\r\\n      found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the\\r\\n      improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a\\r\\n      dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\r\\n      Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n    ',\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain\\r\\n      for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of\\r\\n      his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him\\r\\n      had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not\\r\\n      unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care,\\r\\n      and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained\\r\\n      unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in\\r\\n      the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion\\r\\n      of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys'\\r\\n      invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the\\r\\n      absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom\\r\\n      Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to\\r\\n      go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding,\\r\\n      with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business would have called\\r\\n      him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman\\r\\n      here.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\r\\n      Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\r\\n      Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\\r\\n      of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\r\\n      disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the\\r\\n      polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\r\\n      Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\\r\\n      was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\r\\n      with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\r\\n      speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of\\r\\n      her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\r\\n      spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\\r\\n      not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to\\r\\n      the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.\\r\\n      The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\n      dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising\\r\\n      instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it,\\r\\n      gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a\\r\\n      couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\r\\n      Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\\r\\n      were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\r\\n      her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her\\r\\n      so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing\\r\\n      what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she\\r\\n      was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to\\r\\n      console her:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\\r\\n     ',\n",

       " \"\\r\\n      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\r\\n      hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a\\r\\n      simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\r\\n      in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer,\\r\\n      and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was\\r\\n      arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in\\r\\n      her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood\\r\\n      for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their\\r\\n      silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not\\r\\n      to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater\\r\\n      punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight\\r\\n      observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause\\r\\n      of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:—“It is \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      “Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\r\\n      entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of ',\n",
       " ',\\r\\n      conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of\\r\\n      saying as little as possible.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\r\\n      imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\\r\\n      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn\\r\\n      disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that\\r\\n      will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the\\r\\n      eclat of a proverb.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\\r\\n       said he. “How near it may be to ',\n",

She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the\\r\\n      temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just been\\r\\n      forming a new acquaintance.”\\r\\n     ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that\\r\\n      moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through\\r\\n      the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he\\r\\n      stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing\\r\\n      and his partner.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior\\r\\n      dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first\\r\\n      circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\r\\n      disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\r\\n      especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her\\r\\n      sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow\\r\\n      in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\\r\\n      will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\n      young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\r\\n      William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\r\\n      eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\\r\\n      Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he\\r\\n      turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William's interruption has made me\\r\\n      forget what we were talking of.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\r\\n      interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We\\r\\n      have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are\\r\\n      to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the\\r\\n      same feelings.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\r\\n      no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\\r\\n     ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with\\r\\n      an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your\\r\\n      sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\r\\n      questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\\r\\n      his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\\r\\n      implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him\\r\\n      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been\\r\\n      remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\\r\\n      most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well\\r\\n      that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear\\r\\n      George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could\\r\\n      not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was\\r\\n      excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His\\r\\n      coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I\\r\\n      wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\\r\\n      discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his descent,\\r\\n      one could not expect much better.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said\\r\\n      Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than\\r\\n      of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of \",\n",
       " ', I can assure\\r\\n      you, he informed me himself.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\r\\n      “Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if you\\r\\n      expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in\\r\\n      it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then\\r\\n      sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same\\r\\n      subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a\\r\\n      glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\n      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read\\r\\n      her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment\\r\\n      against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of\\r\\n      Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\r\\n      sister's, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\r\\n      been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\\r\\n      you may be sure of my pardon.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\n      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\\r\\n      history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally\\r\\n      offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity,\\r\\n      and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has\\r\\n      deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am\\r\\n      sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no\\r\\n      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and\\r\\n      has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied.\\r\\n      But what does he say of the living?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them\\r\\n      from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      only.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;\\r\\n      “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since\\r\\n      he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the\\r\\n      rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both\\r\\n      gentlemen as I did before.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\r\\n      which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\\r\\n      delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in\\r\\n      it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to\\r\\n      Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner\\r\\n      she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her\\r\\n      with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most\\r\\n      important discovery.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in\\r\\n      the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\r\\n      gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the\\r\\n      house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\\r\\n      Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\\r\\n      thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\r\\n      in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time\\r\\n      for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he\\r\\n      will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the\\r\\n      connection must plead my apology.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I\\r\\n      believe him to be Lady Catherine's \",\n",
       " \". It will be in my power\\r\\n      to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an\\r\\n      impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not\\r\\n      in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that\\r\\n      if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to\\r\\n      begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined\\r\\n      air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,\\r\\n      replied thus:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your\\r\\n      excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding;\\r\\n      but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the\\r\\n      established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate\\r\\n      the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical\\r\\n      office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided\\r\\n      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You\\r\\n      must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\\r\\n      occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.\\r\\n      Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other\\r\\n      subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I\\r\\n      consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on\\r\\n      what is right than a young lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left\\r\\n      her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly\\r\\n      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\r\\n      Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not\\r\\n      hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of\\r\\n      his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.”\\r\\n       It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing\\r\\n      him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\n      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins,\\r\\n      however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt\\r\\n      seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at\\r\\n      the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\\r\\n      reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\r\\n      me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\\r\\n      that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\\r\\n      certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\r\\n      handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\r\\n      her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train\\r\\n      of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her\\r\\n      perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very\\r\\n      house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\\r\\n      bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\\r\\n      even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\n      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest\\r\\n      she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she\\r\\n      considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of\\r\\n      each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking\\r\\n      to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but\\r\\n      her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an\\r\\n      animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while\\r\\n      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young\\r\\n      man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first\\r\\n      points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how\\r\\n      fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire\\r\\n      the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising\\r\\n      thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw\\r\\n      them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her\\r\\n      time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of\\r\\n      their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than\\r\\n      she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of\\r\\n      pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was\\r\\n      less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period\\r\\n      of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might\\r\\n      soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing\\r\\n      there was no chance of it.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\\r\\n      words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper;\\r\\n      for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of\\r\\n      it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only\\r\\n      scolded her for being nonsensical.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure\\r\\n      we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      may not like to hear.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\\r\\n      to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so\\r\\n      doing!”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\\r\\n      talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\\r\\n      blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\r\\n      glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\r\\n      she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\n      convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\r\\n      of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\r\\n      steady gravity.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\r\\n      had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\r\\n      likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\\r\\n      Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\r\\n      tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\\r\\n      had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\r\\n      preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\r\\n      entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but\\r\\n      in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting\\r\\n      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed\\r\\n      on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through\\r\\n      the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at\\r\\n      their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the\\r\\n      hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after\\r\\n      the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means\\r\\n      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.\\r\\n      Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but\\r\\n      Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two\\r\\n      sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at\\r\\n      Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her\\r\\n      father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.\\r\\n      He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\\r\\n      “That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\\r\\n      Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\\r\\n      her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\r\\n      should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\r\\n      air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\r\\n      compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to\\r\\n      assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music,\\r\\n      for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a\\r\\n      parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement\\r\\n      for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his\\r\\n      patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not\\r\\n      be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his\\r\\n      dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as\\r\\n      possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have\\r\\n      attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards\\r\\n      those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;\\r\\n      nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of\\r\\n      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And\\r\\n      with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so\\r\\n      loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but\\r\\n      no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife\\r\\n      seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and\\r\\n      observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever,\\r\\n      good kind of young man.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose\\r\\n      themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been\\r\\n      impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success;\\r\\n      and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the\\r\\n      exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a\\r\\n      sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That\\r\\n      his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of\\r\\n      ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine\\r\\n      whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of\\r\\n      the ladies, were more intolerable.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\\r\\n      Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he\\r\\n      could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power\\r\\n      to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\r\\n      somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\\r\\n      He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\\r\\n      that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\n      her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\r\\n      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her\\r\\n      greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\\r\\n      good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\\r\\n      though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\r\\n      disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\r\\n      probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a\\r\\n      manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\\r\\n      hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\r\\n      heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\r\\n      sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\\r\\n      were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\r\\n      every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\r\\n      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\\r\\n      speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters\\r\\n      on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness\\r\\n      which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at\\r\\n      all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and\\r\\n      Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked\\r\\n      only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.\\r\\n      Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more\\r\\n      than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by\\r\\n      a violent yawn.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\r\\n      civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\\r\\n      addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\\r\\n      would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\\r\\n      the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\\r\\n      and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\\r\\n      her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\\r\\n      day for a short time.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\\r\\n      delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\r\\n      settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\r\\n      see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\r\\n      months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\\r\\n      with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\r\\n      Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\r\\n      man and the match were quite good enough for ',\n",
       " ', the worth of each\\r\\n      was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\\r\\n      declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his\\r\\n      leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no\\r\\n      feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\\r\\n      moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\r\\n      observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after\\r\\n      breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\r\\n      when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course\\r\\n      of this morning?”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure\\r\\n      Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come,\\r\\n      Kitty, I want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was\\r\\n      hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me.\\r\\n      He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going\\r\\n      away myself.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon\\r\\n      Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to\\r\\n      escape, she added: “Lizzy, I \",\n",
       " ' upon your staying and hearing\\r\\n      Mr. Collins.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's\\r\\n      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\r\\n      over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to\\r\\n      conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between\\r\\n      distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\\r\\n      they were gone, Mr. Collins began.\\r\\n    \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing\\r\\n      you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have\\r\\n      been less amiable in my eyes had there ',\n",
       " \" been this little\\r\\n      unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\\r\\n      mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of\\r\\n      my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\n      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I\\r\\n      entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.\\r\\n      But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it\\r\\n      would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and,\\r\\n      moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a\\r\\n      wife, as I certainly did.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\r\\n      with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not\\r\\n      use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he\\r\\n      continued:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n      “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\r\\n      every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of\\r\\n      matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add\\r\\n      very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to\\r\\n      have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\r\\n      recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\r\\n      patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\r\\n      too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\r\\n      left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson\\r\\n      was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\\r\\n      must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\\r\\n      gentlewoman for \",\n",
       " ' sake; and for your ',\n",
       " \", let her be an\\r\\n      active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a\\r\\n      small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon\\r\\n      as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\\r\\n      way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\r\\n      kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages\\r\\n      in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can\\r\\n      describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,\\r\\n      especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will\\r\\n      inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of\\r\\n      matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards\\r\\n      Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there\\r\\n      are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to\\r\\n      inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,\\r\\n      may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving\\r\\n      to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be\\r\\n      as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,\\r\\n      however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has\\r\\n      been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me\\r\\n      in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the\\r\\n      most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am\\r\\n      perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your\\r\\n      father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that\\r\\n      one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till\\r\\n      after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On\\r\\n      that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure\\r\\n      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are\\r\\n      married.”\\r\\n     \",\n",
       " '\\r\\n      It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\\r\\n      answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\r\\n      the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your\\r\\n      proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline\\r\\n      them.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\r\\n      hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\r\\n      man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\r\\n      favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\\r\\n      third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\\r\\n      said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather extraordinary\\r\\n      one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young\\r\\n      ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their\\r\\n      happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly\\r\\n      serious in my refusal. You could not make ',\n",
       " ' happy, and I am\\r\\n      convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.\\r\\n      Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would\\r\\n      find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins\\r\\n      very gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\\r\\n      disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing\\r\\n      her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty,\\r\\n      economy, and other amiable qualification.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give\\r\\n      me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what\\r\\n      I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do\\r\\n      all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer,\\r\\n      you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my\\r\\n      family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls,\\r\\n      without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as\\r\\n      finally settled.” And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the\\r\\n      room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\r\\n      shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me;\\r\\n      though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it\\r\\n      to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first\\r\\n      application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my\\r\\n      suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\n      character.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me\\r\\n      exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of\\r\\n      encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to\\r\\n      convince you of its being one.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\r\\n      refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\\r\\n      believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\\r\\n      unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be\\r\\n      any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with\\r\\n      the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\r\\n      circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\n      consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\r\\n      means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\\r\\n      portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the\\r\\n      effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore\\r\\n      conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose\\r\\n      to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according\\r\\n      to the usual practice of elegant females.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of\\r\\n      elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be\\r\\n      paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again\\r\\n      for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is\\r\\n      absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak\\r\\n      plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague\\r\\n      you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry;\\r\\n      “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both\\r\\n      your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\\r\\n      reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he\\r\\n      persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\r\\n      encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in\\r\\n      such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be\\r\\n      mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n    ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\n      successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to\\r\\n      watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door\\r\\n      and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the\\r\\n      breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on\\r\\n      the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and\\r\\n      returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to\\r\\n      relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he\\r\\n      trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his\\r\\n      cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful\\r\\n      modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad\\r\\n      to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by\\r\\n      protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could\\r\\n      not help saying so.\\r\\n    ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n      “But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\\r\\n      brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very\\r\\n      headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will ',\n",

If therefore she actually persists in\\r\\n      rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting\\r\\n      me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute\\r\\n      much to my felicity.”\\r\\n     ',\n",
