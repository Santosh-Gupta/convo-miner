       "184  The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient      distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or      four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's      shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and      Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were      more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk      to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in      general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At      present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by      the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to      remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.  \n",

Mr. Phillips      visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity      unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's      large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.  \n",
