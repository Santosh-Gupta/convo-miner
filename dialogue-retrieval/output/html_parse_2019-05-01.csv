She could not imagine what business he could have in town so       soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he       might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by       starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party       for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring       twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls       grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before       the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him       from London—his five sisters and a cousin.

The gentlemen pronounced him       to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer       than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of       his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his       company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in       Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable       countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.",132,0,[],[N],[N]

Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a       contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.       Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,       speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.       He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody       hoped that he would never come there again.

They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private       seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the       habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of       rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of       themselves, and meanly of others.

On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley       had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In       understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,       but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.

The distinction       had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his       business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting       them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from       Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think       with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy       himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his       rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all       attention to everybody.

Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely       allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the       ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no       sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had       a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To       this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had       detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in       her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and       pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of       the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.

495,495,narrative,"In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the       next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for       them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her       daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would       exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with       pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not       to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent       them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday;       and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister       pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against       staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did       she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being       considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to       borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled       that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be       mentioned, and the request made.",863,0,[],[N],[N]

He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of       admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her       with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea       had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material       weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely       spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were       at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most       conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.",863,0,[],[N],[N]

Such doings       discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure       of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to       meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used       to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in       inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins,       being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely       pleased to close his large book, and go.",958,0,[],[N],[N]

560,560,narrative,"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they       had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with       another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr.       Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he       bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all       wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to       find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting       something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the       pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.       Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce       his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from       town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.       This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only       regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in       his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good       figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his       side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same       time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still       standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses       drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.       On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly       towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal       spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on       his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy       corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his       eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the       stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they       looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.       Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a       few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just       deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to       imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.",958,0,[],[N],[N]

She received him with her very best       politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his       intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not       help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship       to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was       quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of       one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about       the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they       already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was       to have a lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. She had been       watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,       and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have       continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a       few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become       ""stupid, disagreeable fellows."" Some of them were to dine with the       Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call       on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from       Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips       protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery       tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such       delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.

To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to       do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent       imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared       very long.

There was no help for       it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a       little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as       she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea       it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that she       was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of       Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings,       in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to       conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and       heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and       though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her       charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the       probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her.       Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that       a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might       never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about       him.",1106,0,[],[N],[N]
640,640,narrative,"If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the       younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this       time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there       was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.       No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after—the very       shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have       found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the       improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a       dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and       Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.",1106,0,[],[N],[N]

642,642,utterance,"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain       for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of       his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him       had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not       unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care,       and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained       unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in       the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion       of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys'       invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the       absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom       Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to       go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding,       with a significant smile, ""I do not imagine his business would have called       him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman       here.""",1108,1,"['""I do not imagine his business would have called       him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman       here.""']","[N] ""I do not imagine his business would have called       him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman       here.""","[N] I do not imagine his business would have called       him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman       here."
643,643,narrative,"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by       Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for       Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling       of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate       disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the       polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.       Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She       was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away       with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in       speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.",1108,0,[],[N],[N]
644,644,narrative,"But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of       her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her       spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had       not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to       the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.       The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were       dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising       instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it,       gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a       couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.",1108,0,[],[N],[N]
645,645,narrative,"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of       Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances       were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with       her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her       so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing       what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she       was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to       console her:",1108,0,[],[N],[N]

648,648,utterance,"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her       hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a       simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant       in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer,       and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was       arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in       her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood       for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their       silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not       to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater       punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight       observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause       of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:—""It is your       turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.

Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other       subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I       consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on       what is right than a young lady like yourself.

700,700,narrative,"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned       her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train       of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her       perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very       house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could       bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring       even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw       were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest       she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she       considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of       each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking       to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but       her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an       animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while       enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young       man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first       points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how       fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire       the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising       thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw       them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her       time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of       their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than       she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of       pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was       less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period       of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might       soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing       there was no chance of it.",1240,0,[],[N],[N]
701,701,narrative,"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's       words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper;       for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of       it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.

704,704,narrative,"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would       talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and       blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently       glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what       she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was       convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression       of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and       steady gravity.",1244,0,[],[N],[N]
705,705,utterance,"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who       had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no       likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.       Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of       tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she       had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,       preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent       entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but       in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting       was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed       on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through       the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at       their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the       hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after       the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means       fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.       Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but       Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two       sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at       Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her       father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.       He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,       ""That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.       Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.""",1246,1,"['""That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.

706,706,narrative,"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and       Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid       her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.",1246,0,[],[N],[N]

I do not mean, however, to       assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music,       for there are certainly other things to be attended to.

708,708,narrative,"To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose       themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been       impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success;       and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the       exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a       sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That       his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of       ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine       whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of       the ladies, were more intolerable.",1250,0,[],[N],[N]

She was teased by       Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he       could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power       to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with       somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.       He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;       that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to       her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her       the whole evening.

Mrs. Hurst and her       sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and       were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed       every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a       languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long       speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters       on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness       which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at       all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and       Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked       only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.       Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more       than the occasional exclamation of ""Lord, how tired I am!"" accompanied by       a violent yawn.",1252,1,"['""Lord, how tired I am!""']","[N] ""Lord, how tired I am!""

My situation in life, my connections with       the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are       circumsances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further       consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no       means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your       portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the       effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.

Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. ""It keeps him in good       humour,"" said she, ""and I am more obliged to you than I can express.""        Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that       it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very       amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any       conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any       return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such       was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when       they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he       had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did       injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to       escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and       hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to       avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him       depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not       willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known       likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte       had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the       adventure of Wednesday.

The       stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship       from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss       Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of       an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.",1426,0,[],[N],[N]

Mr. Collins's present       circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom       they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were       exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more       interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer       Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided       opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the       Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife       should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,       were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of       coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have       done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's       dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had       gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in       general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor       agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be       imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly       either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was       the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and       however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest       preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the       age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the       good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the       surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued       beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably       would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her       feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her       the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he       returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before       any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully       given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity       excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on       his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same       time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his       prosperous love.",1426,0,[],[N],[N]

It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn       instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly       troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was       so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.

But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour       seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience       for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come       back she would think herself very ill used.

My father, however, is partial to Mr Wickham. In short, my       dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you       unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young       people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into       engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of       my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it       would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not       to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first       object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I       will do my best."

924,924,narrative,"This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she       considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All       expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even       wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review       of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to       Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister,       as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had       thrown away.",1600,0,[],[N],[N]

His apparent       partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of       some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could       see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but       slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she       would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden       acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the       young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth,       less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not       quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary,       could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few       struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and       desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.",1600,0,[],[N],[N]

But my feelings are not only cordial towards him;       they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate       her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good       sort of girl. There can be no love in all this.

928,928,narrative,"With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise       diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and       sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take       Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of       going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan       and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as       well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing       Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was       novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable       sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome       for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and,       in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any       delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled       according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William       and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was       added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.",1602,0,[],[N],[N]
929,929,narrative,"The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and       who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told       her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.",1602,0,[],[N],[N]

Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she       had known Sir William's too long.

On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for       their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the       drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a       twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.

Mrs. Gardiner gave her the       particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and       repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and       herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the       acquaintance.",1602,0,[],[N],[N]

954,954,narrative,"At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,       the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,       everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared       at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a       short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole       party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight       of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest       pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she       found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her       cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was       just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to       hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with       no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken       into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them       a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and       punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.",1640,0,[],[N],[N]

But though everything       seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh       of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could       have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said       anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly       was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or       twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did       not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture       in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their       journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them       to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to       the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was       one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command       of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the       exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading       the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an       interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out       with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the       fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the       most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the       country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect       of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park       nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building,       well situated on rising ground.",1640,0,[],[N],[N]

It was       rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up       and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave       Charlotte all the credit.

Elizabeth found herself quite equal       to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.       Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,       which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was       her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their       inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever       she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her       self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind;       and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady       Catherine to be exactly what he represented.",1676,0,[],[N],[N]

There was neither in figure nor face any       likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her       features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little,       except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was       nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she       said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.",1676,0,[],[N],[N]

He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity;       and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who       was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner       which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine       seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious       smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.       The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak       whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and       Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady       Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs.       Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate,       pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.

She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly       and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them       all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as       hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.       Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention,       which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the       intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of       questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose       connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a       very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how       many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself,       whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome,       where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had       been her mother's maiden name?

Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did       not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of       Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too       little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine       was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or       relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to       everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and       apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much.       He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.",1728,0,[],[N],[N]

The party then gathered round       the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have       on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival       of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side       and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon as they had       driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her       opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake,       she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though       costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he       was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.",1728,0,[],[N],[N]

1016,1016,narrative,"Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough       to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of       her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met       with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to       driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went       away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth       was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the       alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now       passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and       looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road.       The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first       rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for       common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect;       but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did,       for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own       apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte       credit for the arrangement.",1728,0,[],[N],[N]

She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes'       conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get       out.",1728,0,[],[N],[N]

Now       and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing       escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.       She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised       them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the       furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted       any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that       Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.",1728,0,[],[N],[N]

1020,1020,narrative,"The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;       and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one       card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of       the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the       neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This, however,       was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time       comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with       Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had       often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she       frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along       the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice       sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she       felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.",1728,0,[],[N],[N]
1021,1021,narrative,"In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.       Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition       to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.       Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected       there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her       acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one       comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be       amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his       behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady       Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke       of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find       that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.",1728,0,[],[N],[N]

On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his       respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for       Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of       his uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the       party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.

Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to       look in Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,       to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met       her with every appearance of composure.

All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books,       and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in       the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or       of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from       this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various       times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now       and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel       Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion       which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by       her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident       admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in       comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel       Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.",1836,0,[],[N],[N]
1088,1088,narrative,"But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to       understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten       minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it       seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to       propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated.       Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's       occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally       different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as       she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the       object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to       find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever       he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her       friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.

How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!       Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a       voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal       inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it       necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor       did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it       struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some       odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford,       her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's       happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly       understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into       Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to       imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed,       if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that       quarter.

They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any       revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.       But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that       cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,       proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly       disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth       noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention       which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful       boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense       of her sister's sufferings.

Wilfully and wantonly       to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite       of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on       our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would       be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose       affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no       comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so       liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in       the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their       motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to       myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be       offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be       obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.",1974,0,[],[N],[N]
1171,1171,letter,"""I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with       others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman       in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at       Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious       attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had       the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir       William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your       sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke       of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From       that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then       perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever       witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were       open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar       regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though       she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any       participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I       must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make       the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to       inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I       shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's       countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a       conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to       be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is       certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and       decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not       believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on       impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to       the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have       the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of       connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there       were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and       existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to       forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be       stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, though       objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety       so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three       younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains       me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest       relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it       give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as       to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally       bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense       and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed       that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every       inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my       friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield       for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the       design of soon returning.",1975,0,[],[N],[N]
1172,1172,letter,"""The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness       had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon       discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching       their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We       accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of       pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described,       and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have       staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would       ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the       assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.       He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not       with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger       dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore,       that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him       against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,       was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done       thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on       which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to       adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's       being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her       brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill       consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me       enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this       concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was       done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other       apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was       unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very       naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.",1976,0,[],[N],[N]
1173,1173,letter,"""With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured       Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his       connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I       am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more       than one witness of undoubted veracity.",1977,0,[],[N],[N]
1174,1174,letter,"""Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years       the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the       discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to       him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore       liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at       Cambridge—most important assistance, as his own father, always poor       from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a       gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young man's       society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest       opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to       provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first       began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the       want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his       best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the       same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in       unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give       you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the       sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature       shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character—it adds even       another motive.",1978,0,[],[N],[N]
1175,1175,letter,"""My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.       Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly       recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that       his profession might allow—and if he took orders, desired that a       valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was       also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive       mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to       inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I       should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate       pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be       benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be       aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very       insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be       sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.       I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was       therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to assistance in the       church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive       it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between       us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to       Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly       lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free       from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For       about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the       incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me       again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me,       and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had       found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved       on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of       which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that       I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my       revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to       comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His       resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and       he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his       reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance       was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most       painfully obtruded on my notice.",1979,0,[],[N],[N]
1176,1176,letter,"""I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,       and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold       to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your       secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the       guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About       a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her       in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to       Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for       there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.       Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her       connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose       affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as       a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent       to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and       after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge       of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the       intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of       grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,       acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.       Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure;       but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.       Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object       was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds;       but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a       strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.",1980,0,[],[N],[N]

1181,1181,narrative,"If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to       contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of       its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly       she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her       feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she       first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and       steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give,       which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice       against everything he might say, she began his account of what had       happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her       power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next       sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one       before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly       resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to       the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He       expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style       was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.",1984,0,[],[N],[N]

Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to       discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ""This must be false! This       cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!""—and when she had       gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the       last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not       regard it, that she would never look in it again.",1986,1,"['""This must be false!

1183,1183,narrative,"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing,       she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was       unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again       began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded       herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of       his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related       himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before       known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each       recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference       was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory,       and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that       there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few       moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she       read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately       following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his       receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again       was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every       circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on       the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both       sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more       clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any       contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less       than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely       blameless throughout the whole.",1986,0,[],[N],[N]
1184,1184,narrative,"The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at       Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could       bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his       entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at       the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,       had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing       had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real       character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of       inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once       in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of       goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might       rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance       of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour       to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many       years' continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see       him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could       remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the       neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in       the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more       continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on       Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between       Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she       was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam       himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his       near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no       reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to       him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and       at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never       have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his       cousin's corroboration.",1986,0,[],[N],[N]
1185,1185,narrative,"She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation       between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.       Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now       struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and       wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting       himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions       with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of       seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he       should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very       next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had       quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that       after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no       reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had       assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing       the son.",1986,0,[],[N],[N]
1186,1186,narrative,"How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His       attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and       hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer       the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His       behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either       been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his       vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most       incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter       and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but       allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his       blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners,       she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an       acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her       a sort of intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to       be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or       immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that       even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often       heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of       some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham       represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly       have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person       capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was       incomprehensible.",1986,0,[],[N],[N]

She saw all the glories of the camp—its tents       stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young       and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw       herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six       officers at once.",2192,0,[],[N],[N]

She lost all concern for him in finding       herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry;       and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof       contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his       attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her       preference secured at any time by their renewal.",2192,0,[],[N],[N]

Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance       of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman       whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their       marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and       confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness       were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort       for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of       those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or       their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes       had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little       otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his       amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general       wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are       wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.",2220,0,[],[N],[N]

But she had never felt so strongly as now the       disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage,       nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a       direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have       preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of       enlarging the mind of his wife.",2220,0,[],[N],[N]
1341,1341,narrative,"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little       other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties       abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and       sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them       threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in       time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain       were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might       be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance       by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon       the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before,       that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not,       in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It       was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement       of actual felicity—to have some other point on which her wishes and       hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation,       console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.       Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was       her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the       discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she       have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been       perfect.",2220,0,[],[N],[N]

Those to her mother contained little else than that       they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had       attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her       quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would       have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent       hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp;       and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be       learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too       full of lines under the words to be made public.",2224,0,[],[N],[N]
1344,1344,narrative,"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good       humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a       happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back       again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was       restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June,       Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;       an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the       following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention       an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious       arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in       Meryton.",2224,0,[],[N],[N]
1345,1345,narrative,"The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast       approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived       from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed       its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out       till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a       month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see       so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and       comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and       substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan,       were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was       enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.       Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had       formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a       few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the       celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.",2224,0,[],[N],[N]
1346,1346,narrative,"Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing       the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough.

1347,1347,utterance,"With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was       impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its       owner.

1348,1348,narrative,"The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away       before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and       Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at       Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two       younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin       Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness       of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching       them, playing with them, and loving them.",2228,0,[],[N],[N]
1349,1349,narrative,"The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next       morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment       was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which       comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness       to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which       might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.",2228,0,[],[N],[N]

A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the       little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and       where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent       their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country;       and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that       Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a       mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before,       Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.

She blushed at the very idea, and thought       it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.       But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it       could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the       family were unfavourably answered.",2236,0,[],[N],[N]
1355,1355,narrative,"Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether       Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor?       and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A       most welcome negative followed the last question—and her alarms now       being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see       the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and       she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of       indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To       Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.",2236,0,[],[N],[N]

1358,1358,narrative,"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They       entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a       beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.",2236,0,[],[N],[N]
1359,1359,narrative,"Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired       every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for       half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable       eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by       Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the       road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building,       standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;       and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into       greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither       formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a       place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so       little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in       their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of       Pemberley might be something!",2236,0,[],[N],[N]
1360,1360,narrative,"They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,       while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of       meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been       mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall;       and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder       at her being where she was.",2236,0,[],[N],[N]
1361,1361,narrative,"The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine,       and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her       into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room,       handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a       window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had       descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a       beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked       on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the       winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they       passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but       from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and       handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor;       but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy       nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than       the furniture of Rosings.",2236,0,[],[N],[N]

1402,1402,narrative,"The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all       that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but       Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already       visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss       Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and       also more intelligible.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1403,1403,narrative,"In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have       little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of       the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested       her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a       smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he       looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest       contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.       Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's       lifetime.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1404,1404,narrative,"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle       sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of       their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was       of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an       intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered       how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of       pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or       evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the       housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the       canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she       thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had       ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its       impropriety of expression.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1405,1405,narrative,"When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,       they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were       consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1406,1406,narrative,"As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to       look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was       conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself       suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1407,1407,narrative,"They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his       appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes       instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest       blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from       surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and       spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of       perfect civility.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1408,1408,narrative,"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received       his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his       first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been       examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.       Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master,       must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was       talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift       her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil       inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since       they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her       embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there       recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some       of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;       when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he       repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of       her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as       plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1409,1409,narrative,"At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments       without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1410,1410,narrative,"The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but       Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,       followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her       coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the       world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light       might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely       thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus       come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner,       they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was       plain that he was that moment arrived—that moment alighted from his       horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness       of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could       it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak       with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she       seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such       gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to       his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!       She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1411,1411,narrative,"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every       step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the       woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before       Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically       to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her       eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the       scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,       whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what       at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he thought of       her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.       Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there       had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had       felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he       certainly had not seen her with composure.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1412,1412,narrative,"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind       aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",2318,0,[],[N],[N]
1413,1413,utterance,"They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,       ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of       the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the       valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading       many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish       of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With       a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled       the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them       again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of       the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple       bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less       adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted       into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst       the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its       windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their       distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could       go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as       possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their       way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest       direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom       able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much       engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water,       and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst       wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and       Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by       the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The       walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them       to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least       more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to       speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few       moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other       path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their       view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she       saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his       politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but       she had not got beyond the words ""delightful,"" and ""charming,"" when some       unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley       from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she       said no more.",2322,2,"['""delightful,""', '""charming,""']","[N] ""delightful,"" [N] ""charming,"" [N]","[N] delightful, [N] charming, [N]"
1414,1414,utterance,"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked       her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This       was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could       hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some       of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to       herself. ""What will be his surprise,"" thought she, ""when he knows who they       are? He takes them now for people of fashion.""",2326,2,"['""What will be his surprise,""', '""when he knows who they       are?

1415,1415,narrative,"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their       relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore       it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he       could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by       the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and       so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into       conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could       not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some       relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most       attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every       expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,       his taste, or his good manners.",2326,0,[],[N],[N]
1416,1416,utterance,"The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite       him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while       he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him       with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where       there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm       with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said       nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for       herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she       repeating, ""Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be       for me—it cannot be for my sake that his manners are       thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as       this.

1417,1417,utterance,"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two       gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink       of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there       chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who,       fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate       to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took       her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short       silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been       assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began       by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—""for your       housekeeper,"" she added, ""informed us that you would certainly not be here       till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that       you were not immediately expected in the country.""

1420,1420,narrative,"The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for       her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that       whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be       the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was       satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made       him think really ill of her.",2340,0,[],[N],[N]

They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the       carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.",2340,0,[],[N],[N]

At last she recollected       that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale       with great perseverance.

1431,1431,narrative,"Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of       his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as       guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his       relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different       construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor       Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.

Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner       dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the       evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many       years' discontinuance.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]

1435,1435,narrative,"Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit       her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently       resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But       her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at       Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with       some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress       themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage       drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle       driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,       guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her       relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her       uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as       she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the       circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the       business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there       was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter       than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born       notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's       feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own       discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the       partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and,       more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every       power of pleasing would fail her.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]
1436,1436,narrative,"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up       and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of       inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]
1437,1437,narrative,"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took       place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was       at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she       had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a       very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She       found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]
1438,1438,narrative,"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though       little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance       womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there       was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly       unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute       and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much       relieved by discerning such different feelings.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]
1439,1439,narrative,"They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was       also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her       satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step       was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All       Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still       felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected       cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He       inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked       and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]
1440,1440,narrative,"To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than       to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them,       indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen       of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with       an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries       the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of       the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the       gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]
1441,1441,narrative,"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the       feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to       make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared       most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she       endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was       ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.",2360,0,[],[N],[N]
1442,1442,utterance,"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how       ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like       manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former       occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he       looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this       might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss       Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either       side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that       could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon       satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted,       which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not       untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to       the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the       others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real       regret, that it ""was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of       seeing her;"" and, before she could reply, he added, ""It is above eight       months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all       dancing together at Netherfield.""",2364,2,"['""was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of       seeing her;""', '""It is above eight       months.

1443,1443,narrative,"Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took       occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all       her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in       the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them       meaning.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1444,1444,narrative,"It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,       whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general       complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from       hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the       improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary       its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him       thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with       whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace—when       she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations       whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in       Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the change was so great, and       struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her       astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear       friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she       seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending       reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his       endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions       were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both       of Netherfield and Rosings.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1445,1445,narrative,"Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to       depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their       wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at       Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a       diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,       readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how       she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its       acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,       that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than       any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of       society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for       her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1446,1446,narrative,"Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth       again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make       after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into       a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this       account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left       them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction,       though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to       be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she       stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of       Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1447,1447,narrative,"But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was       not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was       much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it       was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to       interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1448,1448,narrative,"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as       their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be       untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their       own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other       account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have       recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in       believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the       authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and       whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily       rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their       Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing       to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would       certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the       family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal       man, and did much good among the poor.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1449,1449,narrative,"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held       there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the       son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known       fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him,       which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1450,1450,narrative,"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than       the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not       long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion;       and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She       certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had       almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that       could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable       qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased       to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of       a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and       bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday       had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive       within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;       gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still       well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in       rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.       He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,       seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the       acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any       peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was       soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known       to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only       astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be       attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be       encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly       defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a       real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she       wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for       the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy       told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his       addresses.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1451,1451,narrative,"It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that       such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very       day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late       breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some       exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be       highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They       were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked       herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]

1455,1455,narrative,"On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,       whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.

1456,1456,narrative,"In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with       Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.       Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the       embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing       wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief       of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did       her justice, and pitied her.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1457,1457,narrative,"By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,       on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,       succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a       genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind       of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the       others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from       Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she       wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short       sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1458,1458,narrative,"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,       and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without       calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from       trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient       distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.       Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some       of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the       master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or       feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner       a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was       roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her       family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other       said no more.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1459,1459,narrative,"The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance       of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits       in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look       and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her       of her post. There was now employment for the whole party—for though       they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of       grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1460,1460,narrative,"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether       she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings       which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment       before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret       that he came.",2364,0,[],[N],[N]
1461,1461,narrative,"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other       gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only       on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana       that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be       perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be       made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the       suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there       was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came       into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly       marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her       face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet       made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.       Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk,       and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get       acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at       conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in       the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with       sneering civility:",2364,0,[],[N],[N]

1463,1463,narrative,"In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth       instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the       various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but       exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently       answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an       involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,       earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and       unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then       giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the       hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing       forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her       betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and,       perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which       some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had       ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had       it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and       from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to       conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to       him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a       plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate       him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his       lively concern for the welfare of his friend.",2366,0,[],[N],[N]
1464,1464,narrative,"Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as       Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to       Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to       speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely       recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which       had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed       them on her more and more cheerfully.",2366,0,[],[N],[N]

But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's       recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not       err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana       without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When       Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him       some part of what she had been saying to his sister.",2366,0,[],[N],[N]

Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be       married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he       could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia\'s connections,       which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible!       I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon       their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he       feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and       keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is       not to be expected.

Dearest       Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and       it cannot be delayed.

He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;       for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and       dismissd the chaise that brought them from Epsom.

Her pale face and impetuous manner       made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in       whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily       exclaimed, ""I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.

Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power       was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family       weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither       wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing       consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.

But if       otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or       unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a       first interview with its object, and even before two words have been       exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given       somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,       and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other       less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go       with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must       produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched       business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a       hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,       could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of       her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter       remained in her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that       Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for       money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared       incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment       as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose       Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of       marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor       her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.",2420,0,[],[N],[N]
1499,1499,narrative,"She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that       Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted       only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer,       sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them       in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never       without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards       such a girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!",2420,0,[],[N],[N]
1500,1500,utterance,"She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to       share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a       family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and       requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing       could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost       importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.       and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's       account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them       instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their       summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of       the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had never been a favourite       with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not       Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations       of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his       power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of       gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating       to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as       possible. ""But what is to be done about Pemberley?"" cried Mrs. Gardiner.

An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.       Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained       to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning,       found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed,       seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",2430,0,[],[N],[N]

Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise       with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which       must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no       time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can       alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a       circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's       mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison       of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to       suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of       behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of       indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and       Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be       naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early       an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which       opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady       Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree       with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be       injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine       herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?       And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented       satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been       otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.

It       was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up       any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His       former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the       militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship       with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as       likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own       finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his       fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he       had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel       Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to       clear his expenses at Brighton.

Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia       need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit       could now be purchased for her.

Five daughters       successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.       Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he       would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late       to be saving.

In terms       of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though       expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect       approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the       engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that,       could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with       so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would       scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid       them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual       presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's       expenses had been very little within that sum.",2746,0,[],[N],[N]

But       there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured       wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful       old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of       circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered       certain.",2746,0,[],[N],[N]

That his anger       could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse       his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem       valid, exceeded all she could believe possible.

But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for       the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be       noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so       rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as       soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they       thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of       knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the       neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote       again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come;       and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should       proceed to Longbourn.

The carriage was sent to meet       them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.       Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more       especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself,       had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her       sister must endure.",2761,0,[],[N],[N]

Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and       welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to       Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity       which shewed no doubt of their happiness.",2761,0,[],[N],[N]

The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was       enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was       shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and       fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their       congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly       round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed,       with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.",2761,0,[],[N],[N]

Elizabeth had not before       believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving       within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent       man.

1735,1735,letter,"""On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most       unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several       hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so       dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.       Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and       that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia       once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after       ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The       motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that       Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it       impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He       generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he       had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the       world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his       duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been       brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would       never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to       discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more       than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for       his resolving to follow us.",2825,0,[],[N],[N]
1736,1736,letter,"""There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess       to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of       disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in       Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This       Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went       to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two       or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not       betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she       really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone       to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive       them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At       length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They       were in —— street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on       seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to       persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her       friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his       assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved       on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted       no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they       should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.       Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and       expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham,       he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself       obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which       were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of       Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission       immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very       little about it.

1751,1751,narrative,"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in       which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the       greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had       produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's       match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too       great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the       pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!       He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the       trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which       supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and       despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,       persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid,       and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all       this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did       whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by       other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was       insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her—for a       woman who had already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so       natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of       Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to       be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a       reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of       belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had       liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would       not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe       that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause       where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful,       exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person       who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her       character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every       ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had       ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud       of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able       to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him       again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.

2015,2015,narrative,"The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth       into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn       to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had       actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole       purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a       rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement       could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected       that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being       the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one       wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not       herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them       more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore       (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she       concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost       certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some       future time.",3269,0,[],[N],[N]

From what she had said of her resolution to prevent       their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an       application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar       representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared       not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his       aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose       that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and       it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one,       whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would       address him on his weakest side.

It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of       walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off       together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip       them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to       entertain each other.

She wrote even to       Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former       professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and       though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much       kinder answer than she knew was deserved.",3527,0,[],[N],[N]

2163,2163,narrative,"Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to       Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses       were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was       soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the       contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the       match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a       moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth,       though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the       pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading       and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with       admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he       complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and       expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with       very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir       William was out of sight.",3527,0,[],[N],[N]

Nor       was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to       make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the       frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself,       and to those of her family with whom he might converse without       mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this       took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the       hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when       they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all       the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.",3527,0,[],[N],[N]

With what delighted pride she       afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.       I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of       her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children       produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,       well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky       for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so       unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably       silly.",3527,0,[],[N],[N]

The darling wish of his       sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county       to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source       of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.",3527,0,[],[N],[N]

In society so superior to what she had generally       known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper       as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became,       by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and       less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of       course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to       come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her       father would never consent to her going.",3527,0,[],[N],[N]

Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she       could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer       mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was       suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much       reluctance.",3527,0,[],[N],[N]

2175,2175,narrative,"As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured       in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.       Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of       what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently       sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as       theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants,       and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support;       and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure       of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their       bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace       dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always       moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always       spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into       indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and       her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage       had given her.",3531,0,[],[N],[N]

Georgiana had the highest opinion in the       world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an       astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking       to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which       almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.       Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.
