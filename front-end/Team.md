## Team

Hello everyone! We are a team of 6 data scientists. Our names are Traci, Ray , Rocco, Lingxiao, Lijie, and Joyce. We come from many different nationalities, but are all based out of Singapore. 

In our day jobs and in our spare time, we use Deep Learning to solve a range of NLP problems in NER, Text Classification and Q&A Chatbots. When developing models to solve these tasks, we often have to make a tradeoff between the quicker development times of Keras, and the customizability of tensorflow 1.0.  Thus, the release of tensorflow 2.0 for us was a dream come true. We are excited to be part of the tensorflow community by submitting our own addition to the project base.
