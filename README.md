# Automated Fictional Dialogue Corpus Extractor
Team: Traci. Ray, Rocco, LiJie, LingXiao, Joyce

**More specifically:**

Harness rich human-to-human written dialogues in Project Gutenberg, to generate data for data-driven dialogue systems, aka chatbots. 

**Motivation**:

- Spoken language in movies resembles spontaneous human spoken language (Forchini, 2009)
- Many of the linguistic and paralinguistic features contained within the dialogues are similar to natural spoken language, including dialogue acts such as turn-taking and reciprocity (e.g. returning a greeting when greeted) ([A Survey of Available Corpora for BuildingData-Driven Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05742.pdf))
- Microsoft Chatbots like XiaoIce are hungry for persona-compliant data. Conversational corpora extracted from fiction can match a certain persona or theme, which is useful for empathetic chatbots like XiaoIce.

**Definitions:**

- Utterance: 

  - text prefixed by an opening quote and postfixed by a closing quote, must be spoken by 1 speaker. 
  - E.g. “You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without telling us that you were coming out.” ---> contains 1 utterance. 

- Speaker:

  - Person or character that voiced the utterance. 

- Narrative:

  - Text that is considered non-utterance. (receives a ‘N’ tag)

- Conversation/Dialogue:

  - A sequence of turns uninterrupted by narratives. I.e. a set of utterances
