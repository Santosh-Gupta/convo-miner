The subject elevated him       to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect       he protested that "", '""he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a       person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himslf       experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to       approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of       preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and       had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of       quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people       he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She       had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not       the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood       nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his       relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he       could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in       his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations       he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some       shelves in the closet up stairs.""']",Chapter 14

Mr Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permisson to introduce       his friend, Mr Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from       town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commisson in their corps.       This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only       regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in       his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good       figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his       side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same       time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still       standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses       drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.       On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly       towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal       spokesman, and MissBennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on       his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr Darcy       corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his       eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the       stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they       looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.       Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr Wickham, after a       few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr Darcy just       deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to       imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.""]",Chapter 15

She saw her in idea settled in that very       house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could       bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring       even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw       were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest       she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she       considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of       each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking       to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but       her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.

I have certainly       meant well through the whole affair.

1171,1171,single_quote,"""I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with       others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman       in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at       Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious       attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had       the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir       William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your       sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke       of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From       that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then       perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever       witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were       open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar       regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though       she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any       participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I       must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make       the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to       inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I       shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's       countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a       conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to       be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is       certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and       decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not       believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on       impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to       the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have       the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of       connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there       were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and       existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to       forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be       stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, though       objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety       so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three       younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains       me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest       relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it       give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as       to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally       bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense       and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed       that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every       inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my       friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield       for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the       design of soon returning.",0,[],"[""I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with       others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman       in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at       Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious       attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had       the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir       William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your       sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke       of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From       that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then       perceive that his partiality for MissBennet was beyond what I had ever       witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were       open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar       regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though       she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any       participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I       must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make       the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to       inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I       shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's       countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a       conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to       be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is       certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and       decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not       believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on       impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.

Elizabeth longed to explore its       windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their       distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could       go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as       possible.

The       walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them       to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least       more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to       speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few       moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other       path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their       view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she       saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his       politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but       she had not got beyond the words "", '""delightful,""', '""charming,""', ' when some       unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley       from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she       said no more.']",Chapter 43

His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to       persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her       friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his       assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved       on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted       no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they       should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.       Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and       expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham,       he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himslf       obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which       were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of       Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commisson       immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very       little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he       knew he should have nothing to live on.""]",Chapter 52
