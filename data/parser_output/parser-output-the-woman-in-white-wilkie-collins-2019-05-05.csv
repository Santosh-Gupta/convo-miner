36,36,utterance,"""In his hand, the golden Papa has a letter; and after he has made his
      excuse for disturbing us in our Infernal Region with the common mortal
      Business of the house, he addresses himself to the three young Misses, and
      begins, as you English begin everything in this blessed world that you
      have to say, with a great O. 'O, my dears,' says the mighty merchant, 'I
      have got here a letter from my friend, Mr.——'(the name has
      slipped out of my mind; but no matter; we shall come back to that; yes,
      yes—right-all-right). So the Papa says, 'I have got a letter from my
      friend, the Mister; and he wants a recommend from me, of a drawing-master,
      to go down to his house in the country.' My-soul-bless-my-soul! when I
      heard the golden Papa say those words, if I had been big enough to reach
      up to him, I should have put my arms round his neck, and pressed him to my
      bosom in a long and grateful hug! As it was, I only bounced upon my chair.
      My seat was on thorns, and my soul was on fire to speak but I held my
      tongue, and let Papa go on. 'Perhaps you know,' says this good man of
      money, twiddling his friend's letter this way and that, in his golden
      fingers and thumbs, 'perhaps you know, my dears, of a drawing-master that
      I can recommend?' The three young Misses all look at each other, and then
      say (with the indispensable great O to begin) ""O, dear no, Papa! But here
      is Mr. Pesca' At the mention of myself I can hold no longer—the
      thought of you, my good dears, mounts like blood to my head—I start
      from my seat, as if a spike had grown up from the ground through the
      bottom of my chair—I address myself to the mighty merchant, and I
      say (English phrase) 'Dear sir, I have the man! The first and foremost
      drawing-master of the world! Recommend him by the post to-night, and send
      him off, bag and baggage (English phrase again—ha!), send him off,
      bag and baggage, by the train to-morrow!' 'Stop, stop,' says Papa; 'is he
      a foreigner, or an Englishman?' 'English to the bone of his back,' I
      answer. 'Respectable?' says Papa. 'Sir,' I say (for this last question of
      his outrages me, and I have done being familiar with him—) 'Sir! the
      immortal fire of genius burns in this Englishman's bosom, and, what is
      more, his father had it before him!' 'Never mind,' says the golden
      barbarian of a Papa, 'never mind about his genius, Mr. Pesca. We don't
      want genius in this country, unless it is accompanied by respectability—and
      then we are very glad to have it, very glad indeed. Can your friend
      produce testimonials—letters that speak to his character?' I wave my
      hand negligently. 'Letters?' I say. 'Ha! my-soul-bless-my-soul! I should
      think so, indeed! Volumes of letters and portfolios of testimonials, if
      you like!' 'One or two will do,' says this man of phlegm and money. 'Let
      him send them to me, with his name and address. And—stop, stop, Mr.
      Pesca—before you go to your friend, you had better take a note.'
      'Bank-note!' I say, indignantly. 'No bank-note, if you please, till my
      brave Englishman has earned it first.' 'Bank-note!' says Papa, in a great
      surprise, 'who talked of bank-note? I mean a note of the terms—a
      memorandum of what he is expected to do. Go on with your lesson, Mr.
      Pesca, and I will give you the necessary extract from my friend's letter.'
      Down sits the man of merchandise and money to his pen, ink, and paper; and
      down I go once again into the Hell of Dante, with my three young Misses
      after me. In ten minutes' time the note is written, and the boots of Papa
      are creaking themselves away in the passage outside. From that moment, on
      my faith, and soul, and honour, I know nothing more! The glorious thought
      that I have caught my opportunity at last, and that my grateful service
      for my dearest friend in the world is as good as done already, flies up
      into my head and makes me drunk. How I pull my young Misses and myself out
      of our Infernal Region again, how my other business is done afterwards,
      how my little bit of dinner slides itself down my throat, I know no more
      than a man in the moon. Enough for me, that here I am, with the mighty
      merchant's note in my hand, as large as life, as hot as fire, and as happy
      as a king! Ha! ha! ha! right-right-right-all-right!"" Here the Professor

She\n      turned towards me immediately. The easy elegance of every movement of her\n      limbs and body as soon as she began to advance from the far end of the\n      room, set me in a flutter of expectation to see her face clearly.

      the natural colour, plainly and sparingly trimmed with ribbon to match the

      flaxen, and yet almost as light; not golden, and yet almost as glossy—that
      it nearly melts, here and there, into the shadow of the hat. It is plainly
      parted and drawn back over her ears, and the line of it ripples naturally

      straightness of line; and that the sweet, sensitive lips are subject to a
      slight nervous contraction, when she smiles, which draws them upward a
      little at one corner, towards the cheek. It might be possible to note
      these blemishes in another woman's face but it is not easy to dwell on

I had long since learnt to understand, composedly\n      and as a matter of course, that my situation in life was considered a\n      guarantee against any of my female pupils feeling more than the most\n      ordinary interest in me, and that I was admitted among beautiful and\n      captivating women much as a harmless domestic animal is admitted among\n      them. This guardian experience I had gained early; this guardian\n      experience had sternly and strictly guided me straight along my own poor\n      narrow path, without once letting me stray aside, to the right hand or to\n      the left. And now I and my trusty talisman were parted for the first time.\n      Yes, my hardly-earned self-control was as completely lost to me as if I\n      had never possessed it; lost to me, as it is lost every day to other men,\n      in other critical situations, where women are concerned. I know, now, that\n      I should have questioned myself from the first. I should have asked why\n      any room in the house was better than home to me when she entered it, and\n      barren as a desert when she went out again—why I always noticed and\n      remembered the little changes in her dress that I had noticed and\n      remembered in no other woman's before—why I saw her, heard her, and\n      touched her (when we shook hands at night and morning) as I had never\n      seen, heard, and touched any other woman in my life? I should have looked\n      into my own heart, and found this new growth springing up there, and\n      plucked it out while it was young. Why was this easiest, simplest work of\n      self-culture always too much for me? The explanation has been written\n      already in the three words that were many enough, and plain enough, for my\n      confession. I loved her.""]",

804,804,narrative,"Mrs. Catherick, he informed us, had in past years laid him under some
      obligations for faithful services rendered to his family connections and
      to himself. She had been doubly unfortunate in being married to a husband
      who had deserted her, and in having an only child whose mental faculties
      had been in a disturbed condition from a very early age. Although her
      marriage had removed her to a part of Hampshire far distant from the
      neighbourhood in which Sir Percival's property was situated, he had taken
      care not to lose sight of her—his friendly feeling towards the poor
      woman, in consideration of her past services, having been greatly
      strengthened by his admiration of the patience and courage with which she
      supported her calamities. In course of time the symptoms of mental
      affliction in her unhappy daughter increased to such a serious extent, as
      to make it a matter of necessity to place her under proper medical care.
      Mrs. Catherick herself recognised this necessity, but she also felt the
      prejudice common to persons occupying her respectable station, against
      allowing her child to be admitted, as a pauper, into a public Asylum. Sir
      Percival had respected this prejudice, as he respected honest independence
      of feeling in any rank of life, and had resolved to mark his grateful
      sense of Mrs. Catherick's early attachment to the interests of himself and
      his family, by defraying the expense of her daughter's maintenance in a
      trustworthy private Asylum. To her mother's regret, and to his own regret,
      the unfortunate creature had discovered the share which circumstances had
      induced him to take in placing her under restraint, and had conceived the
      most intense hatred and distrust of him in consequence. To that hatred and
      distrust—which had expressed itself in various ways in the Asylum—the

      uncertainty. He had done his duty to the unhappy young woman, by
      instructing his solicitor to spare no expense in tracing her, and in

      somewhat late in life, and when that marriage united her to an Italian
      gentleman named Fosco, or, rather, to an Italian nobleman—seeing
      that he rejoiced in the title of Count—Mr. Fairlie disapproved of
      her conduct so strongly that he ceased to hold any communication with her,

      members of the family all thought this serious manifestation of resentment
      at his sister's marriage more or less unreasonable. Count Fosco, though
      not a rich man, was not a penniless adventurer either. He had a small but
      sufficient income of his own. He had lived many years in England, and he
      held an excellent position in society. These recommendations, however,

      thousand pounds, was thus rendered doubtful in the extreme; and Madame
      Fosco resented her brother's treatment of her as unjustly as usual in such

Our longest separation\n      was when her mother took her to Limmeridge. Just at that time I lost my\n      husband, and I felt it was as well, in that miserable affliction, that\n      Anne should not be in the house. She was between ten and eleven years old\n      then, slow at her lessons, poor soul, and not so cheerful as other\n      children—but as pretty a little girl to look at as you would wish to\n      see. I waited at home till her mother brought her back, and then I made\n      the offer to take her with me to London—the truth being, sir, that I\n      could not find it in my heart to stop at Old Welmingham after my husband\'s\n      death, the place was so changed and so dismal to me.""']",
