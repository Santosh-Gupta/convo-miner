What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An       express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from       Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one       of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To       Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very       sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the       best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and       indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice       over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,       for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly       grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let       them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.       They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not       missd till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly.       My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel       Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines       for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I       cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to       make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.""","""By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I       wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my       head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest       Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and       it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr Wickham and       our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken       place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day       before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to       Mrs F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green,       something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never       intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to       Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to       trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;       for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and       dismissd the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after       this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what       to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel       F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the       turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no       such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he       came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most       creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs F., but       no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very       great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill       of him. Many circumsances might make it more eligible for them to be       married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he       could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections,       which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible!       I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon       their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he       feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and       keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is       not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so       affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but       as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad,       dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing       scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for       your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if       inconvenient. Adieu!

I know my dear uncle and       aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still       something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with       Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I       am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to       pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is       obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.
