Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite.

And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.

I pity, though I cannot help blaming       her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say       that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure       that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself       farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet       if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so       deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on       his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her       having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we       must have met, long ago.

I am afraid you will not be able to       make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.""","""By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I       wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my       head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest       Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and       it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr Wickham and       our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken       place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day       before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to       Mrs F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green,       something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never       intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to       Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to       trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;       for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and       dismissd the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after       this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what       to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel       F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the       turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no       such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he       came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most       creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs F., but       no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very       great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill       of him. Many circumsances might make it more eligible for them to be       married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he       could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections,       which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible!       I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon       their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he       feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and       keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is       not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so       affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but       as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad,       dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing       scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for       your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if       inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told       you I would not; but circumsances are such that I cannot help earnestly       begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and       aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still       something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with       Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I       am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to       pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is       obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my       uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will       immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""",B-OTHER,Chapter 46,train

1509,"""I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,       for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the       truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.       But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your       fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject       will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot       greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal       more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not       going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of       the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the       happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before,       but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only       smiles, I laugh. Mr Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can       spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc.""","""Yours sincerely, etc.""",B-OTHER,Chapter 60,train
