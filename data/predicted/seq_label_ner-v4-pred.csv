1,"The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr Collins made his       declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his       leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no       feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himslf even at the       moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the       observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding       Mrs Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after       breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:",O,715
2,"""May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,       when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course       of this morning?""",B-START,716
3,"Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs       Bennet answered instantly, ",O,717
4,"""Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure       Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come,       Kitty, I want you up stairs.""",B-OTHER,717
5," And, gathering her work together, she was       hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:",O,717
6,"""Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr Collins must excuse me.       He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going       away myself.""",B-OTHER,718
7,"""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.""",B-OTHER,719
8,"""Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing       Mr Collins.""",I-OTHER,719
9,"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's       consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it       over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to       conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between       distress and diversion. Mrs Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as       they were gone, Mr Collins began.",O,720
10,"""Believe me, my dear MissElizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing       you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have       been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little       unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected       mother's permisson for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of       my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my       attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I       entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.       But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it       would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and,       moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a       wife, as I certainly did.""",B-OTHER,721
11,"The idea of Mr Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away       with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not       use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he       continued:",O,722
12,"""My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for       every clergyman in easy circumsances (like myself) to set the example of       matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add       very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to       have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and       recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling       patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On       that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are       married.""",B-OTHER,723
13,It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.,O,724
14,"""You are too hasty, sir,""",B-OTHER,725
15,"""You forget that I have made no       answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for       the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your       proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline       them.""",I-OTHER,725
16,"""I am not now to learn,""",B-OTHER,726
17,"""that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the       man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their       favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a       third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just       said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""",I-OTHER,726
18,"""Upon my word, sir,""",B-OTHER,727
19,"""your hope is a rather extraordinary       one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young       ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their       happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly       serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am       convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.       Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would       find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.""",I-OTHER,727
20,"""Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,""",B-OTHER,728
21,"""but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all       disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing       her again, I shall speak in the very highest termsof your modesty,       economy, and other amiable qualification.""",I-OTHER,728
22,"""Indeed, Mr Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give       me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what       I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do       all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer,       you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my       family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls,       without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as       finally settled.""",B-OTHER,729
23," And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the       room, had Mr Collins not thus addressed her:",O,729
24,"""When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I       shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me;       though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it       to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first       application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my       suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female       character.""",B-OTHER,730
25,"""Really, Mr Collins,""",B-OTHER,731
26,"""you puzzle me       exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of       encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to       convince you of its being one.""",I-OTHER,731
27,"""You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your       refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for       believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is       unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be       any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with       the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are       circumsances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further       consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no       means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your       portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the       effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore       conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose       to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according       to the usual practice of elegant females.""",B-OTHER,732
28,"""I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of       elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be       paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again       for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is       absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak       plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague       you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.""",B-OTHER,733
29,"""You are uniformly charming!""",B-START,734
30,"""and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both       your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.""",I-START,734
31,"To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no       reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he       persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering       encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in       such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be       mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.",O,735
32,Chapter 20,O,736
33,"Mr Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his       successful love; for Mrs Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to       watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door       and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the       breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm termson       the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr Collins received and       returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to       relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he       trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his       cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful       modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.",O,737
34,"This information, however, startled Mrs Bennet; she would have been glad       to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by       protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could       not help saying so.",O,738
35,"""But, depend upon it, Mr Collins,""",B-START,739
36,"""that Lizzy shall be       brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very       headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make       her know it.""",I-START,739
37,"""Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,""",B-OTHER,740
38,"""but if she is       really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be       a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for       happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in       rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting       me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute       much to my felicity.""",I-OTHER,740
39,"""Sir, you quite misunderstand me,""",B-OTHER,741
40,"""Lizzy is       only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as       good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr Bennet, and       we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.""",I-OTHER,741
41,"She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her       husband, called out as she entered the library, ",O,742
42,"""Oh! Mr Bennet, you are       wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy       marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not       make haste he will change his mind and not have her.""",B-START,742
43,"Mr Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on       her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her       communication.",O,743
44,"""I have not the pleasure of understanding you,""",B-OTHER,744
45,"""Of what are you talking?""",I-OTHER,744
46,"""Of Mr Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr Collins,       and Mr Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.""",O,745
47,"""And what am I to do on the occasion? It seemsan hopeless business.""",B-OTHER,746
48,"""Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her       marrying him.""",B-OTHER,747
49,"""Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.""",B-OTHER,748
50,"Mrs Bennet rang the bell, and MissElizabeth was summoned to the library.",O,749
51,"""Come here, child,""",B-START,750
52,"""I have sent for you       on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr Collins has made you an       offer of marriage. Is it true?""",I-START,750
53,"""Very well—and       this offer of marriage you have refused?""",B-OTHER,750
54,"""I have, sir.""",B-OTHER,751
55,"""Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your       accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs Bennet?""",B-OTHER,752
56,"""Yes, or I will never see her again.""",B-OTHER,753
57,"""An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must       be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again       if you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will never see you again if       you do.""",B-START,754
58,"Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,       but Mrs Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the       affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.",O,755
59,"""What do you mean, Mr Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist       upon her marrying him.""",B-OTHER,756
60,"""My dear,""",B-OTHER,757
61,"""I have two small favours to request.       First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the       present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the       library to myself as soon as may be.""",I-OTHER,757
62,"Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs       Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed       and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her       interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and       Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful       gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her       determination never did.",O,758
63,"Mr Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He       thought too well of himslf to comprehend on what motives his cousin could       refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.       His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her       deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.",O,759
64,"While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the       day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her,       cried in a half whisper, ",O,760
65,"""I am glad you are come, for there is such fun       here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr Collins has made an       offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.""",B-START,760
66,"Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who       came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the       breakfast-room, where Mrs Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on       the subject, calling on MissLucas for her compassion, and entreating her       to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.       ",O,761
67,"""Pray do, my dear MissLucas,""",B-OTHER,761
68,"""for nobody       is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels       for my poor nerves.""",I-OTHER,761
69,Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.,O,762
70,"""Aye, there she comes,""",B-START,763
71,"""looking as unconcerned as       may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she       can have her own way. But I tell you, MissLizzy—if you take it into       your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will       never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to       maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and       so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the       library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will       find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful       children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.       People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great       inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always       so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.""",I-START,763
72,"Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any       attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the       irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of       them, till they were joined by Mr Collins, who entered the room with an       air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the       girls, ",O,764
73,"""Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues,       and let me and Mr Collins have a little conversation together.""",B-OTHER,764
74,"Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but       Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,       detained first by the civility of Mr Collins, whose inquiries after       herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little       curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not       to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs Bennet began the projected conversation:       ",O,765
75,"""Oh! Mr Collins!""",B-START,765
76,"""My dear madam,""",B-OTHER,766
77,"""let us be for ever silent on this point. Far       be it from me,""",I-OTHER,766
78,"""to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to       inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man       who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust       I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive       happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied       begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I       hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,       by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without       having paid yourself and Mr Bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be       objectionable in having accepted my dismisson from your daughter's lips       instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly       meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an       amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of       all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I       here beg leave to apologise.""",B-OTHER,766
79,Chapter 21,O,767
80,"The discussion of Mr Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and       Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily       attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother.       As for the gentleman himslf, his feelings were chiefly expressed,       not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by       stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her,       and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himslf were       transferred for the rest of the day to MissLucas, whose civility in       listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to       her friend.",O,768
81,"The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs Bennet's ill-humour or ill       health. Mr Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth       had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did       not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on       Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.",O,769
82,"After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr Wickham       were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.       He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their       aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was       well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that       the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.",O,770
83,"""I found,""",B-START,771
84,"""as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr       Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many       hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might       arise unpleasant to more than myself.""",I-START,771
85,"She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full       discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed       on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to       Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His       accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it       offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of       introducing him to her father and mother.",O,772
86,"Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to MissBennet; it came       from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,       hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and       Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her       dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself       soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual       cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on       the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner       had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her       to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking       out the letter, said:",O,773
87,"""This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good       deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their       way to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You       shall hear what she says.""",O,774
88,"She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of       their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and       of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr Hurst had a house.       The next was in these words: ",O,775
89,"""I do not pretend to regret anything I shall       leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we       will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful       intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of       separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend       on you for that.""",B-START,775
90," To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with       all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their       removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not       to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr       Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was       persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.",O,775
91,"""It is unlucky,""",B-OTHER,776
92,"""that you should not be       able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not       hope that the period of future happiness to which MissBingley looks       forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful       intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater       satisfaction as sisters?

Many of my acquaintances are already there       for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had       any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair. I       sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties       which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so       numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall       deprive you.""",B-OTHER,778

I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you       my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without       confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.

But the case is       this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more       anxious to get MissDarcy for her brother, from the notion that when there       has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving       a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it       would succeed, if Missde Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest       Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because MissBingley tells you her       brother greatly admires MissDarcy, he is in the smallest degree less       sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday,       or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in       love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.""",B-OTHER,788

After lamenting       it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr Bingley       would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion       of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited       only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.",O,798

124,"        Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that       it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very       amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any       conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any       return of Mr Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such       was MissLucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when       they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he       had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did       injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to       escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and       hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himslf at her feet. He was anxious to       avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him       depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not       willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known       likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte       had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the       adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering       kind. MissLucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards       the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But       little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her       there.",O,800
125,"In as short a time as Mr Collins's long speeches would allow, everything       was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered       the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him       the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the       present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The       stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship       from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss      Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of       an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.",O,801
126,"Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and       it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr Collins's present       circumsances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom       they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were       exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more       interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer       Mr Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided       opinion, that whenever Mr Collins should be in possession of the       Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife       should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,       were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of       coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have       done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's       dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had       gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in       general satisfactory. Mr Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor       agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be       imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly       either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was       the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and       however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest       preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the       age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the       good luck of it. The least agreeable circumsance in the business was the       surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued       beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably       would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her       feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her       the information herself, and therefore charged Mr Collins, when he       returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before       any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully       given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity       excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on       his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same       time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his       prosperous love.",O,802
127,"As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the       family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved       for the night; and Mrs Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said       how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his       engagements might allow him to visit them.",O,803

As for my fair cousins, though my absence       may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the       liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin       Elizabeth.""",B-OTHER,809
136,"With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally       surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs Bennet wished to       understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her       younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She       rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a       solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means       so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve       himslf by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable       companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done       away. MissLucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference       with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.",O,810
137,"The possibility of Mr Collins's fancying himslf in love with her friend       had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that       Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she       could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so       great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not       help crying out:",O,811
138,"""Engaged to Mr Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!""",B-START,812
139,"The steady countenance which MissLucas had commanded in telling her       story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a       reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained       her composure, and calmly replied:",O,813
140,"""Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible       that Mr Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,       because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?""",B-START,814
141,"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for       it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their       relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all       imaginable happiness.",O,815
142,"""I see what you are feeling,""",B-OTHER,816
143,"""You must be surprised,       very much surprised—so lately as Mr Collins was wishing to marry       you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be       satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was.       I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr Collins's character,       connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of       happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the       marriage state.""",I-OTHER,816
144,Elizabeth quietly answered ,O,817
145,"""Undoubtedly;""",B-OTHER,817
146," and after an awkward pause, they       returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer,       and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a       long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable       a match. The strangeness of Mr Collins's making two offers of marriage       within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She       had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like       her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into       action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly       advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr Collins was a most humiliating       picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her       esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for       that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.",O,817
147,Chapter 23,O,818
148,"Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she       had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir       William Lucas himslf appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her       engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much       self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he       unfolded the matter—to an audience not merely wondering, but       incredulous; for Mrs Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,       protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and       often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:",O,819
149,"""Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know       that Mr Collins wants to marry Lizzy?""",B-START,820
150,"Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without       anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through       it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his       information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most       forbearing courtesy.",O,821
151,"Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a       situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning       her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a       stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of       her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by       Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be       expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr Collins, and the       convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",O,822
152,"Mrs Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir       William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a       rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of       the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr Collins had been taken       in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and       fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however,       were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real       cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously       misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during       the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her.       Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could       see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could       speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months       were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.",O,823
153,"Mr Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as       he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it       gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been       used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more       foolish than his daughter!",O,824
154,"Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less       of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor       could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia       were far from envying MissLucas, for Mr Collins was only a clergyman;       and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at       Meryton.",O,825
155,"Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on       Mrs Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called       at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though       Mrs Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to       drive happiness away.",O,826
156,"Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them       mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real       confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in       Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose       rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and       for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been       gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.",O,827
157,"Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the       days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of       thanks from Mr Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and       written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in       the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that       head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his       happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour,       MissLucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of       enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind       wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to       return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily       approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as       possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his       amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.",O,828
158,"Mr Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure       to Mrs Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of       it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn       instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly       troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was       so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such       were the gentle murmurs of Mrs Bennet, and they gave way only to the       greater distress of Mr Bingley's continued absence.",O,829
159,"Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day       passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report       which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield       the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs Bennet, and which       she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.",O,830
160,"Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but       that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she       was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so       dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its       frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and       of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of MissDarcy and       the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength       of his attachment.",O,831
161,"As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more       painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of       concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was       never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour       seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience       for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come       back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady       mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.",O,832
162,"Mr Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his       reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his       first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and       luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a       great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at       Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make       an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.",O,833
163,"Mrs Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of       anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and       wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss      Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her       with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she       concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she       spoke in a low voice to Mr Collins, was convinced that they were talking       of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters       out of the house, as soon as Mr Bennet were dead.

176,"MissBingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first       sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for       the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time       to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the       country.",O,845
177,"Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of       the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the       writer, that could give her any comfort. MissDarcy's praise occupied the       chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline       boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the       accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.       She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr       Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with       regard to new furniture.",O,846
178,"Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,       heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for       her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's assertion of       her brother's being partial to MissDarcy she paid no credit. That he was       really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much       as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without       anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of       proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends,       and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their       inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he       might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought       best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be       sensible himslf. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be       long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else;       and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed       by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's       attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the       case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the       difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally       wounded.",O,847

Remember that she is one of a large       family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to       believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and       esteem for our cousin.""",B-OTHER,856

My dear Jane, Mr Collins is a       conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I       do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him       cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it       is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change       the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself       or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security       for happiness.""",B-OTHER,857

We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves       intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always       so guarded and circumsect.

Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not       believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of       a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but       though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had       the same story to repeat every day.

He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused       him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter       married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much       entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They       are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.

It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his       affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends       successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.",O,892

When the       engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it—of       which officers Mr Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,       Mrs Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation,       narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to       be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough       to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the       subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence       of encouraging such an attachment.",O,894

About ten or a dozen years ago, before her       marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of       Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances       in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of       Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence       of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.",O,895

In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute       description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of       praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him       and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr Darcy's       treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed       disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident       at last that she recollected having heard Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly       spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.",O,896

254,"Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for       the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice       being given on such a point, without being resented.",O,907
255,"Mr Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by       the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his       arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs Bennet. His marriage was now       fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it       inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she ",O,908
256,"""wished       they might be happy.""",B-START,908
257," Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday       MissLucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave,       Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes,       and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they       went downstairs together, Charlotte said:",O,908
258,"""I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.""",B-START,909
259,"""That you certainly shall.""",B-OTHER,910

262,"""I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to       come to Hunsford.""",B-OTHER,913

264,"""My father and Maria are coming to me in March,""",B-START,915
265,"""and I       hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as       welcome as either of them.""",I-START,915
266,"The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the       church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject       as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence       was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally       unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without       feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined       not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been,       rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good       deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would       speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy       she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were       read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point       exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed       surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not       praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her       taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It       was Mr Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and       Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the       rest.",O,916
267,"Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe       arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be       in her power to say something of the Bingleys.",O,917
268,"Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience       generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or       hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that       her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been       lost.",O,918
269,"""My aunt,""",B-START,919
270,"""is going to-morrow into that part of the town,       and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.""",I-START,919
271,"She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen MissBingley. ",O,920
272,"""I       did not think Caroline in spirits,""",B-START,920
273,"""but she was very glad       to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to       London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I       inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged       with Mr Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that MissDarcy       was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as       Caroline and Mrs Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon       here.""",I-START,920
274,Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident       only could discover to Mr Bingley her sister's being in town.,O,921
275,"Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to       persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be       blind to MissBingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning       for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the       visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,       the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no       longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will       prove what she felt.",O,922
276,"""My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her       better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been       entirely deceived in MissBingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,       though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I       still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was       as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for       wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumsances were to       happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not       return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive       in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,       said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so       altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to       continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming       her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say       that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure       that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself       farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet       if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so       deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on       his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her       having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we       must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from       something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of       talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to       MissDarcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging       harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong       appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every       painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your       affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me       hear from you very soon. MissBingley said something of his never       returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any       certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have       such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them,       with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours,       etc.""",B-START,923
277,"This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she       considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All       expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even       wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review       of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to       Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr Darcy's sister,       as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had       thrown away.",O,924
278,"Mrs Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning       that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send       as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent       partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of       some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could       see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but       slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she       would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden       acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the       young lady to whom he was now rendering himslf agreeable; but Elizabeth,       less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not       quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary,       could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few       struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and       desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.",O,925
279,"All this was acknowledged to Mrs Gardiner; and after relating the       circumsances, she thus went on: ",O,926
280,"""I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I       have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and       elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him       all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him;       they are even impartial towards MissKing. I cannot find out that I hate       her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good       sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been       effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to       all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say       that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be       purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to       heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open       to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something       to live on as well as the plain.""",B-OTHER,926
