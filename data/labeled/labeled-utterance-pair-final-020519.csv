He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;       for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and       dismissd the chaise that brought them from Epsom.

Impossible!       I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon       their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he       feared W. was not a man to be trusted.
