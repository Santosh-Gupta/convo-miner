Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her       twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second       time. First of all, he asked MissLucas. I was so vexed to see him stand       up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody       can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down       the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her       for the two next. Then the two third he danced with MissKing, and the two       fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two       sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger—',\n"," \"If he had had any compassion for me, [N] he would not have danced half so much!

So high and so conceited that there was no enduring       him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himslf so very great!       Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to       have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.',\n"," 'He is just what a young man ought to be, [N] sensible,       good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much       ease, with such perfect good breeding!',\n"," 'He is also handsome, [N] which a young man ought       likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.',\n"," 'I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did       not expect such a compliment.',\n"," 'Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us.       Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What       could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing       that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.       No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable,       and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.',\n"," 'Dear Lizzy!',\n"," 'Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.       You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in       your eyes.

With your       good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!       Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it       everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take       the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say       nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's       sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\",\n"," 'Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when you       converse with them. MissBingley is to live with her brother, and keep his       house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming       neighbour in her.',\n"," \"You began the evening well, Charlotte, [N] You were Mr Bingley's first       choice.\",\n"," 'Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.',\n"," 'Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.

Mr Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton       assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty       women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his       answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest MissBennet,       beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'\",\n"," 'Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem as       if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.',\n"," 'My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours,       Eliza, [N] Mr Darcy is not so well worth listening to as       his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.',\n"," \"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his       ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a       misfortune to be liked by him.

[N] I certainly saw Mr Darcy speaking to her.\",\n"," 'Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he       could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being       spoke to.',\n"," 'MissBingley told me, [N] that he never speaks much, unless       among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably       agreeable.',\n"," 'I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable,       he would have talked to Mrs Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody       says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow       that Mrs Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a       hack chaise.',\n"," 'I do not mind his not talking to Mrs Long, [N] but I wish       he had danced with Eliza.',\n"," 'Another time, Lizzy, [N] I would not dance with him,       if I were you.',\n"," \"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with       him.\",\n"," 'His pride, [N] does not offend me so much as pride       often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so       very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,       should think highly of himslf. If I may so express it, he has a right       to be proud.',\n"," 'That is very true, [N] and I could easily forgive his       pride, if he had not mortified mine.',\n"," 'Pride, [N] is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever       read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is       particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not       cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or       other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though       the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being       vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we       would have others think of us.',\n"," 'If I were as rich as Mr Darcy, [N] I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of       foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.',\n"," 'Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought, [N] and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.',\n"," 'It may perhaps be pleasant, [N] to be able to impose on       the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so       very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from       the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will       then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.       There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that       it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a       slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have       heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out       of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels.       Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like       her, if she does not help him on.',\n"," 'But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can       perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to       discover it too.',\n"," \"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\",\n"," 'But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it,       he must find it out.',\n"," 'Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane       meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they       always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every       moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore       make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention.       When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love       as much as she chooses.',\n"," \"Your plan is a good one, [N] where nothing is in       question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to       get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But       these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she       cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its       reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances       with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has       since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to       make her understand his character.\",\n"," 'Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might       only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember       that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings       may do a great deal.',\n"," 'Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both       like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading       characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.',\n"," 'Well, [N] I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she       were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of       happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.       Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions       of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar       beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.

I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her.       You have a sweet room here, Mr Bingley, and a charming prospect over the       gravel walk.

It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own       partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother       Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure       he would make her an offer before we came away.

The power of doing anything with quickness is always       prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the       imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs Bennet this morning       that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in       five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to       yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance       which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real       advantage to yourself or anyone else?',\n"," 'Nay, [N] this is too much, to remember at night all the       foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I       believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.       At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless       precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.',\n"," \"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would       be gone with such celerity.

Allowing the case, however, to stand       according to your representation, you must remember, MissBennet, that the       friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of       his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in       favour of its propriety.',\n"," 'To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend       is no merit with you.',\n"," 'To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of       either.',\n"," 'You appear to me, Mr Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of       friendship and affection.

I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have       supposed about Mr Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the       circumsance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour       thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,       where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no       very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with       the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?',\n"," 'Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange       with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain       to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the       parties?',\n"," 'By all means, [N] let us hear all the particulars, not       forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more       weight in the argument, MissBennet, than you may be aware of. I assure       you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with       myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not       know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in       particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,       when he has nothing to do.',\n"," 'I see your design, Bingley, [N] You dislike an argument,       and want to silence this.',\n"," 'Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss      Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very       thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.',\n"," 'What you ask, [N] is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr Darcy       had much better finish his letter.',\n"," 'Do not you feel a great inclination, MissBennet, to seize such an       opportunity of dancing a reel?',\n"," \"Oh! [N] I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine       what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might       have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in       overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their       premeditated contempt.

His father, MissBennet, the late Mr Darcy, was one of       the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I       can never be in company with this Mr Darcy without being grieved to the       soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been       scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and       everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the       memory of his father.',\n"," 'It was the prospect of constant society, and good society, [N] which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it       to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me       further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great       attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society,       I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits       will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A       military life is not what I was intended for, but circumsances have now       made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I       was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in       possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were       speaking of just now.',\n"," 'Indeed!',\n"," 'Yes—the late Mr Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the       best living in his gift.

Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I       was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no       less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done       anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may       have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can       recall nothing worse.

He was most highly esteemed by Mr Darcy, a most intimate, confidential       friend. Mr Darcy often acknowledged himslf to be under the greatest       obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately       before my father's death, Mr Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of       providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of       gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.\",\n"," 'How strange! [N] How abominable! I wonder that the very       pride of this Mr Darcy has not made him just to you!

It has       connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are       none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger       impulses even than pride.',\n"," 'Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?',\n"," 'Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money       freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the       poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for he is very proud of       what his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his       family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of       the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.

She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,       and, I understand, highly accomplished.

I do not mean, however, to       assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music,       for there are certainly other things to be attended to.

He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not       be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his       dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as       possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have       attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards       those to whom he owes his preferment.

Almost as soon as I       entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.       But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it       would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and,       moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a       wife, as I certainly did.\",\n"," \"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for       every clergyman in easy circumsances (like myself) to set the example of       matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add       very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to       have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and       recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling       patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On       that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are       married.\",\n"," 'You are too hasty, sir, [N] You forget that I have made no       answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for       the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your       proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline       them.',\n"," 'I am not now to learn, [N] that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the       man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their       favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a       third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just       said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.',\n"," 'Upon my word, sir, [N] your hope is a rather extraordinary       one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young       ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their       happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly       serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am       convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.

I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do       all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer,       you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my       family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls,       without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as       finally settled. [N]',\n"," 'When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I       shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me;       though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it       to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first       application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my       suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female       character.',\n"," 'Really, Mr Collins, [N] you puzzle me       exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of       encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to       convince you of its being one.',\n"," 'You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your       refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for       believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is       unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be       any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with       the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are       circumsances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further       consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no       means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your       portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the       effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore       conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose       to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according       to the usual practice of elegant females.',\n"," 'I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of       elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be       paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again       for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is       absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak       plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague       you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.',\n"," 'You are uniformly charming! [N] and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both       your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.',\n"," 'But, depend upon it, Mr Collins, [N] that Lizzy shall be       brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very       headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make       her know it.',\n"," 'Pardon me for interrupting you, madam, [N] but if she is       really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be       a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for       happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in       rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting       me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute       much to my felicity.',\n"," 'Sir, you quite misunderstand me, [N] Lizzy is       only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as       good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr Bennet, and       we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.',\n"," '[N] Oh! Mr Bennet, you are       wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy       marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not       make haste he will change his mind and not have her.',\n"," 'I have not the pleasure of understanding you, [N] Of what are you talking?',\n"," 'Of Mr Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr Collins,       and Mr Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.',\n"," 'And what am I to do on the occasion? It seemsan hopeless business.',\n"," 'Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her       marrying him.',\n"," 'Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.',\n"," 'Come here, child, [N] I have sent for you       on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr Collins has made you an       offer of marriage. Is it true? [N] Very well—and       this offer of marriage you have refused?',\n"," 'I have, sir.',\n"," 'Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your       accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs Bennet?',\n"," 'Yes, or I will never see her again.',\n"," 'An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must       be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again       if you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will never see you again if       you do.',\n"," 'What do you mean, Mr Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist       upon her marrying him.',\n"," 'My dear, [N] I have two small favours to request.       First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the       present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the       library to myself as soon as may be.',\n"," '[N] I am glad you are come, for there is such fun       here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr Collins has made an       offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.',\n"," '[N] Pray do, my dear MissLucas, [N] for nobody       is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels       for my poor nerves.',\n"," 'Aye, there she comes, [N] looking as unconcerned as       may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she       can have her own way. But I tell you, MissLizzy—if you take it into       your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will       never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to       maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and       so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the       library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will       find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful       children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.       People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great       inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always       so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.',\n"," '[N] Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues,       and let me and Mr Collins have a little conversation together.',\n"," '[N] Oh! Mr Collins!',\n"," \"My dear madam, [N] let us be for ever silent on this point. Far       be it from me, [N] to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to       inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man       who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust       I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive       happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied       begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I       hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,       by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without       having paid yourself and Mr Bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be       objectionable in having accepted my dismisson from your daughter's lips       instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly       meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an       amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of       all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I       here beg leave to apologise.\",\n"," 'I found, [N] as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr       Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many       hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might       arise unpleasant to more than myself.',\n"," 'This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good       deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their       way to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You       shall hear what she says.',\n"," '[N] I do not pretend to regret anything I shall       leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we       will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful       intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of       separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend       on you for that. [N]',\n"," 'It is unlucky, [N] that you should not be       able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not       hope that the period of future happiness to which MissBingley looks       forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful       intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater       satisfaction as sisters? Mr Bingley will not be detained in London by       them.',\n"," 'Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into       Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:',\n"," 'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which       took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are       certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles       gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined       on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant       hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there       for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had       any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair. I       sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties       which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so       numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall       deprive you.',\n"," 'It is evident by this, [N] that he comes back no more this       winter.',\n"," 'It is only evident that MissBingley does not mean that he should.',\n"," 'Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master.       But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which       particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you.',\n"," \"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we       are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana       Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the       affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something       still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being       hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you       my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without       confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My       brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now       of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the       connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading       me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's       heart. With all these circumsances to favour an attachment, and nothing       to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an       event which will secure the happiness of so many?\",\n"," \"What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy? [N] Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare       that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is       perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she       suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to       put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\",\n"," 'Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?',\n"," 'Most willingly.',\n"," 'You shall have it in a few words. MissBingley sees that her brother is       in love with you, and wants him to marry MissDarcy. She follows him to       town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does       not care about you.',\n"," 'Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you       together can doubt his affection. MissBingley, I am sure, cannot. She is       not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr Darcy       for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is       this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more       anxious to get MissDarcy for her brother, from the notion that when there       has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving       a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it       would succeed, if Missde Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest       Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because MissBingley tells you her       brother greatly admires MissDarcy, he is in the smallest degree less       sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday,       or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in       love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.',\n"," 'If we thought alike of MissBingley, [N] your representation       of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust.       Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can       hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.',\n"," 'That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you       will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.       You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.',\n"," 'But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in       accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry       elsewhere?',\n"," 'You must decide for yourself, [N] and if, upon mature       deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is       more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by       all means to refuse him.',\n"," 'How can you talk so? [N] You must know that       though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could       not hesitate.',\n"," 'I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider       your situation with much compassion.',\n"," 'But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.       A thousand things may arise in six months!',\n"," '[N] It keeps him in good       humour, [N] and I am more obliged to you than I can express. [N]',\n"," 'My dear madam, [N] this invitation is particularly gratifying,       because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very       certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.',\n"," \"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good       sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending       your patroness.\",\n"," \"My dear sir, [N] I am particularly obliged to you for       this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a       step without her ladyship's concurrence.\",\n"," 'You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her       displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us       again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,       and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.',\n"," 'Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such       affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from       me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard       during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence       may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the       liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin       Elizabeth.',\n"," 'Engaged to Mr Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!',\n"," \"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible       that Mr Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,       because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\",\n"," \"I see what you are feeling, [N] You must be surprised,       very much surprised—so lately as Mr Collins was wishing to marry       you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be       satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was.       I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr Collins's character,       connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of       happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the       marriage state.\",\n"," '[N] Undoubtedly; [N]',\n"," 'Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know       that Mr Collins wants to marry Lizzy?',\n"," 'Indeed, Mr Bennet, [N] it is very hard to think that Charlotte       Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to       make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!',\n"," 'My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better       things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.',\n"," 'I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was       not for the entail, I should not mind it.',\n"," 'What should not you mind?',\n"," 'I should not mind anything at all.',\n"," 'Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such       insensibility.',\n"," \"I never can be thankful, Mr Bennet, for anything about the entail. How       anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own       daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr Collins too!       Why should he have it more than anybody else?\",\n"," 'I leave it to yourself to determine, [N]',\n"," 'Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no       idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I       will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all       be as we were before.',\n"," 'You doubt me, [N] indeed, you have no       reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my       acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and       nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A       little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better.',\n"," '[N] I have this comfort immediately,       that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it       has done no harm to anyone but myself.',\n"," 'My dear Jane! [N] you are too good. Your sweetness and       disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I       feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.',\n"," \"Nay, [N] this is not fair. You wish to think all the       world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to       think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be       afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege       of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really       love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world,       the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirmsmy belief of       the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence       that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with       two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's       marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!\",\n"," \"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin       your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of       situation and temper. Consider Mr Collins's respectability, and       Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large       family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to       believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and       esteem for our cousin.\",\n"," 'To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else       could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that       Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her       understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr Collins is a       conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I       do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him       cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it       is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change       the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself       or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security       for happiness.',\n"," 'I must think your language too strong in speaking of both, [N] and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But       enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two       instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not       to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your       opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves       intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always       so guarded and circumsect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity       that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.',\n"," 'And men take care that they should.',\n"," 'If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of       there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.',\n"," \"I am far from attributing any part of Mr Bingley's conduct to design, [N] but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others       unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,       want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will       do the business.\",\n"," 'And do you impute it to either of those?',\n"," 'Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I       think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.',\n"," 'You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?',\n"," 'Yes, in conjunction with his friend.',\n"," 'I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only       wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure       it.',\n"," 'Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his       happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may       wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great       connections, and pride.',\n"," \"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose MissDarcy, [N] but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They       have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love       her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely       they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think herself       at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If       they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he       were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make       everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not       distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or,       at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel       in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light,       in the light in which it may be understood.\",\n"," '[N] So, Lizzy, [N] your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being       married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is       something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her       companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long       outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to       disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your       man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.',\n"," \"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not       all expect Jane's good fortune.\",\n"," 'True, [N] but it is a comfort to think that whatever of       that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make       the most of it.',\n"," \"I do not blame Jane, [N] for Jane would have got Mr Bingley       if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she       might have been Mr Collins's wife by this time, had it not been for her       own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused       him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter       married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much       entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They       are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.       It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family,       and to have neighbours who think of themslves before anybody else.       However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I       am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.\",\n"," '[N] It       seemslikely to have been a desirable match for Jane, [N] I am       sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as       you describe Mr Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a       few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that       these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.',\n"," 'An excellent consolation in its way, [N] but it will not do       for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often       happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of       independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in       love with only a few days before.',\n"," \"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful,       so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied       to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real,       strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr Bingley's love?\",\n"," 'I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite       inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they       met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two       or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him       twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms       Is not general incivility the very essence of love?',\n"," 'Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.       Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not       get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy;       you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she       would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of       service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as       anything.',\n"," 'I hope, [N] that no consideration with regard to this       young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all       our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so       little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he       really comes to see her.',\n"," \"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his       friend, and Mr Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a       part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr Darcy may       perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he       would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its       impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr Bingley       never stirs without him.\",\n"," 'So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane       correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling.',\n"," 'She will drop the acquaintance entirely.',\n"," 'You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you       are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.       Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or       endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would       make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a       most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I       should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your       fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.       Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am       sure. You must not disappoint your father.',\n"," 'My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.',\n"," 'Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.',\n"," 'Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself,       and of Mr Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent       it.',\n"," 'Elizabeth, you are not serious now.',\n"," \"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr       Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the       most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to       me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the       imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr Darcy! My father's       opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to       forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr Wickham. In short, my       dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you       unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young       people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into       engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of       my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it       would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not       to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first       object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I       will do my best.\",\n"," 'Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very       often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting       him.',\n"," \"As I did the other day, [N] very       true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not       imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has       been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the       necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my       honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you       are satisfied.\",\n"," '[N] wished       they might be happy. [N]',\n"," 'I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.',\n"," 'That you certainly shall.',\n"," 'And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?',\n"," 'We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.',\n"," 'I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to       come to Hunsford.',\n"," 'My father and Maria are coming to me in March, [N] and I       hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as       welcome as either of them.',\n"," 'My aunt, [N] is going to-morrow into that part of the town,       and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.',\n"," '[N] I       did not think Caroline in spirits, [N] but she was very glad       to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to       London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I       inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged       with Mr Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that MissDarcy       was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as       Caroline and Mrs Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon       here.',\n"," \"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her       better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been       entirely deceived in MissBingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,       though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I       still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was       as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for       wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumsances were to       happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not       return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive       in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,       said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so       altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to       continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming       her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say       that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure       that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself       farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet       if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so       deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on       his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her       having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we       must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from       something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of       talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to       MissDarcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging       harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong       appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every       painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your       affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me       hear from you very soon. MissBingley said something of his never       returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any       certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have       such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them,       with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours,       etc.\",\n"," '[N] I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I       have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and       elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him       all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him;       they are even impartial towards MissKing. I cannot find out that I hate       her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good       sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been       effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to       all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say       that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be       purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to       heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open       to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something       to live on as well as the plain.',\n"," 'But my dear Elizabeth, [N] what sort of girl is MissKing? I       should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.',\n"," 'Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,       between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,       and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,       because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl       with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.',\n"," 'If you will only tell me what sort of girl MissKing is, I shall know       what to think.',\n"," 'She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.',\n"," \"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death       made her mistress of this fortune.\",\n"," 'No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my       affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making       love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?',\n"," 'But there seemsan indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so       soon after this event.',\n"," 'A man in distressed circumsances has not time for all those elegant       decorumswhich other people may observe. If she does not object to       it, why should we?',\n"," 'Her not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her       being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.',\n"," 'Well, [N] have it as you choose. He shall be       mercenary, and she shall be foolish.',\n"," 'No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you       know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.',\n"," 'Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in       Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not       much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow       where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has       neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones       worth knowing, after all.',\n"," 'Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.',\n"," 'We have not determined how far it shall carry us, [N] but, perhaps, to the Lakes.',\n"," '[N] Oh, my dear, dear aunt, [N] what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh       life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to       rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when       we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being       able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we       have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes,       mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations;       nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin       quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be       less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.',\n"," \"Yes, MissElizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de       Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be       delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt       not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service       is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and       my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your       stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at       Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her       ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one       of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.\",\n"," 'Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed, [N] and a most attentive neighbour.',\n"," 'Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.

I will not tell you what it is. Make       haste, and come down this moment.',\n"," 'And is this all? [N] I expected at least that the pigs       were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her       daughter.',\n"," 'La! my dear, [N] it is not Lady       Catherine. The old lady is Mrs Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other       is Missde Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who       would have thought that she could be so thin and small?',\n"," 'She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.       Why does she not come in?',\n"," 'Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours       when Missde Bourgh comes in.',\n"," 'I like her appearance, [N] She       looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make       him a very proper wife.',\n"," \"I confess, [N] that I should not have been at all surprised by her       ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at       Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it       would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who       could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an       invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your       arrival!\",\n"," 'I am the less surprised at what has happened, [N] from       that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my       situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such       instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.',\n"," 'Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady       Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes       herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of       your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for       anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being       simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.',\n"," \"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr Collins, I think. For your sake, [N] I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion       for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary       in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, MissBennet?\",\n"," 'A little.',\n"," 'Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our       instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall       try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?',\n"," 'One of them does.',\n"," 'Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The MissWebbs       all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you       draw?',\n"," 'No, not at all.',\n"," 'What, none of you?',\n"," 'Not one.',\n"," 'That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother       should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.',\n"," 'My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.',\n"," 'Has your governess left you?',\n"," 'We never had any governess.',\n"," 'No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home       without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have       been quite a slave to your education.',\n"," 'Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must       have been neglected.',\n"," 'Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished       to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and       had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle,       certainly might.',\n"," \"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had       known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage       one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady       and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is       wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that       way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces       of Mrs Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it       was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was       merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted       with her. Mrs Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling yesterday       to thank me? She finds MissPope a treasure. 'Lady Catherine,' said she,       'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss     Bennet?\",\n"," \"Yes, ma'am, all.\",\n"," 'All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The       younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters       must be very young?',\n"," \"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be       much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon       younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and       amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to       marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth       as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it       would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of       mind.\",\n"," 'Upon my word, [N] you give your opinion very decidedly       for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?',\n"," 'With three younger sisters grown up, [N] your       ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.',\n"," 'You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal       your age.',\n"," 'I am not one-and-twenty.',\n"," 'I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr Darcy would never       have come so soon to wait upon me.',\n"," 'My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never       happened to see her there?',\n"," 'What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of?       What are you telling MissBennet? Let me hear what it is.',\n"," 'We are speaking of music, madam, [N]',\n"," 'Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must       have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are       few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music       than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should       have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed       her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.       How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?',\n"," 'I am very glad to hear such a good account of her, [N] and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does       not practice a good deal.',\n"," 'I assure you, madam, [N] that she does not need such advice.       She practises very constantly.',\n"," \"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to       her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell       young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without       constant practice. I have told MissBennet several times, that she will       never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs Collins       has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come       to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs Jenkinson's room.       She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house.\",\n"," 'You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear       me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.       There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at       the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate       me.',\n"," 'I shall not say you are mistaken, [N] because you could not       really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had       the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great       enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your       own.',\n"," '[N] Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and       teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in       meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of       the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.       Indeed, Mr Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you       knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say,       very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such       things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.',\n"," 'I am not afraid of you, [N]',\n"," 'Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of, [N] I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.',\n"," 'You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very       dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must       know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He       danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain       knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.       Mr Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.',\n"," 'I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly       beyond my own party.',\n"," 'True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel       Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.',\n"," 'Perhaps, [N] I should have judged better, had I sought an       introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.',\n"," 'Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this? [N] Shall we ask him why a man of sense and       education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend       himslf to strangers?',\n"," 'I can answer your question, [N] without applying to him.       It is because he will not give himslf the trouble.',\n"," 'I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, [N] of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch       their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I       often see done.',\n"," \"My fingers, [N] do not move over this instrument in the       masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same       force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have       always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the       trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers       as capable as any other woman's of superior execution.\",\n"," '[N] You are perfectly right. You have employed your       time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can       think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.',\n"," \"MissBennet would not play at all amissif she practised more, and could       have the advantage of a London master.

He has many friends, and is at a       time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.',\n"," 'If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the       neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might       possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr Bingley did not       take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his       own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.',\n"," 'I should not be surprised, [N] if he were to give it up as soon       as any eligible purchase offers.',\n"," '[N] This seemsa very comfortable       house.

Anything beyond       the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.',\n"," 'I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.       The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying       circumsances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling       unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here.       Mr and Mrs Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will       allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not       call herself near her family under less than half the       present distance.',\n"," '[N] You       cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.

Younger sons cannot marry where       they like.',\n"," 'Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often       do.',\n"," 'Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my       rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.',\n"," \"Is this, [N] meant for me? [N] And pray, what is       the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very       sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\",\n"," 'I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of       having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a       lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well       for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he       likes with her.',\n"," 'No, [N] that is an advantage which he must divide       with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of MissDarcy.',\n"," 'Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your       charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a       little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may       like to have her own way.',\n"," 'You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say       she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very       great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs Hurst and Miss      Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.',\n"," \"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he       is a great friend of Darcy's.\",\n"," 'Oh! yes, [N] Mr Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr       Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.',\n"," 'Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in       those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in       our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to       him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that       Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.',\n"," 'What is it you mean?',\n"," \"It is a circumsance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,       because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an       unpleasant thing.\",\n"," 'You may depend upon my not mentioning it.',\n"," 'And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.       What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himslf on having       lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent       marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I       only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man       to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been       together the whole of last summer.',\n"," 'Did Mr Darcy give you reasons for this interference?',\n"," 'I understood that there were some very strong objections against the       lady.',\n"," 'And what arts did he use to separate them?',\n"," 'He did not talk to me of his own arts, [N] He       only told me what I have now told you.',\n"," \"I am thinking of what you have been telling me, [N] Your cousin's       conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\",\n"," 'You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?',\n"," \"I do not see what right Mr Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his       friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to       determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But, [N] as we know none of the particulars, it       is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much       affection in the case.\",\n"," \"That is not an unnatural surmise, [N] but it is a       lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.\",\n"," 'There were some very strong objections against the lady, [N]',\n"," 'To Jane herself, [N] there could be no possibility of       objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding       excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could       anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities,       has abilities Mr Darcy himslf need not disdain, and respectability which       he will probably never reach. [N]',\n"," 'In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be       repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love       you.',\n"," 'In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express       a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they       may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I       could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I       have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it       most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has       been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short       duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the       acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it       after this explanation.',\n"," 'And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I       might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour       at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.',\n"," 'I might as well inquire, [N] why with so evident a desire of       offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against       your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not       this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other       provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had       they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that       any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means       of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?',\n"," 'I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can       excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare       not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only       means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the       censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its       derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the       acutest kind.',\n"," 'Can you deny that you have done it? [N]',\n"," '[N] I have no wish of denying that       I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or       that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than       towards myself.',\n"," 'But it is not merely this affair, [N] on which my dislike is       founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided.       Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months       ago from Mr Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what       imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what       misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?',\n"," \"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns, [N]\",\n"," 'Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an       interest in him?',\n"," 'His misfortunes! [N] yes, his misfortunes       have been great indeed.',\n"," 'And of your infliction, [N] You have reduced       him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You have       withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.       You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which       was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you       can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.',\n"," 'And this, [N] is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I       thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this       calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps, [N] these offenses might have been overlooked,       had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that       had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations       might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my       struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by       unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by       everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed       of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me       to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate       myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly       beneath my own?',\n"," 'You are mistaken, Mr Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your       declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern       which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more       gentlemanlike manner.',\n"," 'You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that       would have tempted me to accept it.',\n"," 'From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost say—of       my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest       belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the       feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation       on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had       not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the       world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.',\n"," 'You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings,       and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for       having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your       health and happiness.',\n"," '[N] I have been walking in the grove       some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading       that letter? [N]',\n"," 'FITZWILLIAM DARCY',\n"," '[N] This must be false! This       cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!

I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often       disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in       useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how       just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more       wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with       the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the       very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and       ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this       moment I never knew myself.',\n"," '[N] What would she have said? how would she have       behaved? [N]',\n"," '[N] I assure       you, I feel it exceedingly, [N] I believe no one feels       the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to       these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were       excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied       his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most       acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings       certainly increases.',\n"," 'But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you       may stay a little longer. Mrs Collins will be very glad of your company,       I am sure.',\n"," 'I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation, [N] but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next       Saturday.',\n"," 'Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you       to stay two months. I told Mrs Collins so before you came. There can be       no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs Bennet could certainly spare you       for another fortnight.',\n"," 'But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.',\n"," 'Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters       are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another       month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as       London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does       not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of       you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should       not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.',\n"," 'You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original       plan.',\n"," '[N] Mrs Collins, you must send a servant       with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of       two young women travelling post by themslves. It is highly improper. You       must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world       to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and       attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana       went to Ramsate last summer, I made a point of her having two       men-servants go with her. MissDarcy, the daughter of Mr Darcy, of       Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a       different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must       send John with the young ladies, Mrs Collins. I am glad it occurred to me       to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let       them go alone.',\n"," 'My uncle is to send a servant for us.',\n"," 'Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have       somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh!       Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be       attended to.',\n"," 'I know not, MissElizabeth, [N] whether Mrs Collins has yet       expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very       certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.       The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how       little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of       living, our small roomsand few domestics, and the little we see of the       world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself;       but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we       have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time       unpleasantly.',\n"," \"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not       disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having       it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our       connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home       scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot       have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's       family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which       few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually       we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the       disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding       in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at       Rosings.\",\n"," \"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into       Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be       able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs Collins you have       been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that       your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as       well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear MissElizabeth, that I       can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My       dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is       in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between       us. We seem to have been designed for each other.\",\n"," 'But, [N] you will of course wish to have your humble respects       delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you       while you have been here.',\n"," 'Good gracious! [N] it seemsbut       a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!',\n"," 'A great many indeed, [N]',\n"," 'We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!       How much I shall have to tell!',\n"," '[N] And how much I shall have to conceal!',\n"," '[N] Is not       this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?',\n"," 'And we mean to treat you all, [N] but you must lend us the       money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there. [N] Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think       it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall       pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any       better.',\n"," '[N] Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have       bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will       be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this       summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are       going in a fortnight.',\n"," 'Are they indeed! [N]',\n"," 'They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to       take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and       I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too       of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!',\n"," 'Yes, [N] that would be a delightful scheme       indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a       whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one       poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!',\n"," 'Now I have got some news for you, [N] What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and       about a certain person we all like!',\n"," \"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the       waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse       things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he       is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my       news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There       is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone       down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\",\n"," 'And Mary King is safe! [N] safe from a connection       imprudent as to fortune.',\n"," 'She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.',\n"," 'But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side, [N]',\n"," 'I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never       cared three straws about her—who could about such a nasty little       freckled thing?',\n"," \"How nicely we are all crammed in, [N] I am glad I bought my       bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let       us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And       in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you       went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I       was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you       came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost       three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married       before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands,       you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr Collins; but I       do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like       to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to       all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at       Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs       Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs       Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two       Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by       herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in       woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a       soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs Forster, and Kitty and me, except my       aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot       imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or       three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord!       how I laughed! and so did Mrs Forster. I thought I should have died. And       that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out       what was the matter.\",\n"," 'I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.',\n"," 'Oh! Mary, [N] I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!       As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was       nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had       not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very       handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon       in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.       And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have       got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so       merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might       have heard us ten miles off!',\n"," '[N] Far be it from me, my dear sister, to       depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the       generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charmsfor me—I       should infinitely prefer a book.',\n"," 'His being so sure of succeeding was wrong, [N] and certainly       ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his       disappointment!',\n"," 'Indeed, [N] I am heartily sorry for him; but he has       other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You       do not blame me, however, for refusing him?',\n"," 'Blame you! Oh, no.',\n"," 'But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?',\n"," 'No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.',\n"," 'But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next       day.',\n"," \"This will not do, [N] you never will be able to make both       of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied       with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just       enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting       about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;       but you shall do as you choose.\",\n"," 'I do not know when I have been more shocked, [N] Wickham so very       bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only       consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the       knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of       his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.',\n"," 'Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full       of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing       every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me       saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light       as a feather.',\n"," 'Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!       such an openness and gentleness in his manner!',\n"," 'There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those       two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the       appearance of it.',\n"," 'I never thought Mr Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as       you used to do.',\n"," \"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to       him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an       opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually       abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at       a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\",\n"," 'Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the       matter as you do now.',\n"," 'Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And       with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say       that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!       Oh! how I wanted you!',\n"," 'How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in       speaking of Wickham to Mr Darcy, for now they do appear wholly       undeserved.',\n"," \"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most       natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one       point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or       ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's       character.\",\n"," '[N] Surely there can be no       occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?',\n"," 'That it ought not to be attempted. Mr Darcy has not authorised me to       make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative       to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I       endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will       believe me? The general prejudice against Mr Darcy is so violent, that it       would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place       him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone;       and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some       time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their       stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about       it.',\n"," 'You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for       ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to       re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.',\n"," '[N] And then, [N] if that very       improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell       what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himslf.

For my part, I am determined never to       speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day.       But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is       a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there's the least       chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his       coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of       everybody, too, who is likely to know.\",\n"," 'I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.',\n"," 'Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I       shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I       would not have put up with it.

Well, well, I only hope it will       last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent       manager, I dare say.

There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare       say.',\n"," 'No, nothing at all.',\n"," 'A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, they       will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be       distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!

They look       upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.',\n"," 'It was a subject which they could not mention before me.',\n"," 'No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they       often talk of it between themslves.

Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been       kept aloof by Lydia's folly.\",\n"," \"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of       particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our       importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild       volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's       character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father,       will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of       teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her       life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will       be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever       made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and       meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a       tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind,       wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her       rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is       comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle,       and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it       possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are       known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?\",\n"," 'Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you       must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage       for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly sisters.       We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let       her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of       any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to       anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt       than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their       notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own       insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without       authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.',\n"," 'How long did you say he was at Rosings?',\n"," 'Nearly three weeks.',\n"," 'And you saw him frequently?',\n"," 'Yes, almost every day.',\n"," \"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\",\n"," 'Yes, very different.

Has he deigned to add aught of       civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope, [N] that he is improved in essentials.',\n"," 'Oh, no! [N] In essentials, I believe, he is very much what       he ever was.',\n"," 'When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his       mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing       him better, his disposition was better understood.',\n"," 'You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr Darcy, will readily       comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume       even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction,       may be of service, if not to himslf, to many others, for it must only       deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear       that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,       is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and       judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I       know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his       wish of forwarding the match with Missde Bourgh, which I am certain he       has very much at heart.',\n"," \"But it is fortunate, [N] that I have something to wish for.       Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.

And       there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one       an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who       showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly       help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and       that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.',\n"," '[N] was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of       seeing her; [N] It is above eight       months.

She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we       should not have known her again.',\n"," 'For my own part, [N] I must confess that I never could see       any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy;       and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character—there       is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of       the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so       fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp,       shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there       is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.',\n"," \"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all       were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect       your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, 'She       a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards       she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty       at one time.\",\n"," 'Yes, [N] but that       was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have       considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.',\n"," 'Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most       unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be       assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An       express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from       Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one       of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To       Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very       sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the       best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and       indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice       over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,       for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly       grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let       them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.       They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not       missd till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly.       My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel       Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines       for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I       cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to       make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.',\n"," \"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I       wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my       head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest       Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and       it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr Wickham and       our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken       place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day       before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to       Mrs F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green,       something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never       intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to       Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to       trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further;       for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and       dismissd the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after       this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what       to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel       F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the       turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no       such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he       came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most       creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs F., but       no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very       great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill       of him. Many circumsances might make it more eligible for them to be       married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he       could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections,       which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible!       I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon       their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he       feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and       keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is       not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so       affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but       as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad,       dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing       scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for       your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if       inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told       you I would not; but circumsances are such that I cannot help earnestly       begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and       aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still       something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with       Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I       am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to       pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is       obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my       uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will       immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\",\n"," 'Oh! where, where is my uncle? [N] I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr       Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an       instant to lose.',\n"," 'Good God! what is the matter? [N] I will not detain you a minute;       but let me, or let the servant go after Mr and Mrs Gardiner. You are not       well enough; you cannot go yourself.',\n"," '[N] Let       me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present       relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.',\n"," 'No, I thank you, [N] There is       nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some       dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.',\n"," '[N] I have just had a letter from Jane, with such       dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has       left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power       of—of Mr Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You       know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,       nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.',\n"," '[N] When I consider, [N] that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he       was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I       learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not       have happened. But it is all—all too late now.',\n"," 'I am grieved indeed, [N] grieved—shocked. But is it       certain—absolutely certain?',\n"," 'Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced       almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to       Scotland.',\n"," 'And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?',\n"," \"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's       immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But       nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done. How       is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have       not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\",\n"," 'When my eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I       known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid       of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!',\n"," \"[N] I am afraid you have been long desiring my       absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real,       though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either       said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But       I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask       for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's       having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\",\n"," 'Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to MissDarcy. Say that urgent       business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as       it is possible, I know it cannot be long.',\n"," '[N] But what is to be done about Pemberley? [N] John told us Mr Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?',\n"," 'Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That       is all settled.',\n"," 'What is all settled? [N] And are they upon such termsas for her to disclose the real       truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!',\n"," \"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth, [N] and really, upon serious consideration, I am much       more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the       matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form       such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless,       and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly       inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step       forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such       an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the       risk!\",\n"," 'Do you really think so? [N]',\n"," \"Upon my word, [N] I begin to be of your uncle's       opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and       interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.       Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable       of it?\",\n"," 'Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect       I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not       hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?',\n"," 'In the first place, [N] there is no absolute proof       that they are not gone to Scotland.',\n"," 'Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a       presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the       Barnet road.',\n"," 'Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there,       though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It       is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it       might strike them that they could be more economically, though less       expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.',\n"," \"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their       marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most       particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never       intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some       money. He cannot afford it. And what claimshas Lydia—what       attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make       him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himslf by marrying       well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps       might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge;       for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as       to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has       no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's       behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed       to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do       as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a       matter.\",\n"," 'But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as       to consent to live with him on any termsother than marriage?',\n"," \"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed, [N] that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a       point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps       I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been       taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for       a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and       vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and       frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since       the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,       flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing       everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give       greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which       are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm       of person and address that can captivate a woman.\",\n"," 'But you see that Jane, [N] does not think so very ill of       Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.',\n"," 'Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be       their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,       till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what       Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense       of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false       and deceitful as he is insinuating.',\n"," 'And do you really know all this? [N]',\n"," 'I do indeed, [N] I told you, the other day,       of his infamous behaviour to Mr Darcy; and you yourself, when last at       Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with       such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other       circumsances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while       to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From       what he said of MissDarcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,       reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himslf. He must       know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.',\n"," 'But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and       Jane seem so well to understand?',\n"," \"Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and       saw so much both of Mr Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was       ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire       was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case,       neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to       make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any       one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should       then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with       Mrs Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never       occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception       never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue,       you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.\",\n"," 'When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I       suppose, to believe them fond of each other?',\n"," 'Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side;       and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours       is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered       the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every       girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two       months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention;       and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild       admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who       treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.',\n"," 'Not yet, [N] But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope       everything will be well.',\n"," 'Is my father in town?',\n"," 'Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.',\n"," 'And have you heard from him often?',\n"," 'We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say       that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I       particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write       again till he had something of importance to mention.',\n"," 'And my mother—how is she? How are you all?',\n"," 'My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly       shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you       all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank       Heaven, are quite well.',\n"," 'But you—how are you? [N] You look pale. How much you       must have gone through!',\n"," \"If I had been able, [N] to carry my point in going to Brighton,       with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear       Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go       out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on       their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had       been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the       charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And       now here's Mr Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,       wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of       us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and       if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.\",\n"," 'Do not give way to useless alarm, [N] though it is right to be       prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It       is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may       gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and       have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As       soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home       with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what       is to be done.',\n"," 'Oh! my dear brother, [N] that is exactly what I could       most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever       they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry.       And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia       she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are       married. And, above all, keep Mr Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a       dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and have       such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasmsin my       side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no       rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any       directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know       which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you       will contrive it all.',\n"," 'This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.       But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosomsof       each other the balm of sisterly consolation.',\n"," '[N] Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful       lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false       step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle       than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her       behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.',\n"," '[N] But tell me all and everything about it which I have       not already heard.

They must have seen them together for ever.',\n"," \"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,       especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so       grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was       coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea       of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got       abroad, it hastened his journey.\",\n"," 'And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of       their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himslf?',\n"," 'Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of       their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not       repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I       am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.',\n"," 'And till Colonel Forster came himslf, not one of you entertained a       doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?',\n"," \"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a       little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in       marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.       My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a       match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing       more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her       for such a step. She had known, it seems of their being in love with each       other, many weeks.\",\n"," 'But not before they went to Brighton?',\n"," 'No, I believe not.',\n"," 'And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himslf?

It had come with a fare from       London; and as he thought that the circumsance of a gentleman and lady's       removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make       inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the       coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries       there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and       number of the coach.
