My situation in life, my connections with       the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are       circumsances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further       consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no       means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your       portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the       effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore       conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose       to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according       to the usual practice of elegant females.\"</td>\n",

I would rather be       paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again       for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is       absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak       plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague       you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"</td>\n",

But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it       would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and,       moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a       wife, as I certainly did.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "6   \"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for       every clergyman in easy circumsances (like myself) to set the example of       matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add       very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to       have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and       recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling       patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On       that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are       married.\"   \n",

But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it       would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and,       moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a       wife, as I certainly did.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "5   \"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for       every clergyman in easy circumsances (like myself) to set the example of       matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add       very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to       have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and       recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling       patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked       too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I       left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs Jenkinson       was arranging Missde Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr Collins, you       must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a       gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an       active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a       small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon       as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the       way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and       kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages       in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,       especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will       inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of       matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards       Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there       are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to       inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,       may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving       to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be       as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which,       however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has       been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me       in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am       perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your       father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that       one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till       after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On       that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are       married.\"   \n",
