My reasons for       believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is       unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be       any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with       the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are       circumsances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further       consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no       means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your       portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the       effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore       conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose       to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according       to the usual practice of elegant females.\"   \n",
